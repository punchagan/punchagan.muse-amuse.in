Sigh! I made yet another change to the way this blog gets published.
But, I have a feeling this mechanism, is here to stay!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We've been using Nikola quite regularly for our &lt;a href="http://ultimatesport.in"&gt;Ultimate site&lt;/a&gt;, and I
quite like it.  I've also contributed a bunch of features to Nikola to
get it to work the way I would like it to.  This weekend I ported my
blog from &lt;a href="https://github.com/renard/o-blog"&gt;o-blog&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://getnikola.com"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;.  The only thing that was stopping me
from doing it, until now is the fact that all my posts are in
org markup and porting them over to one of the formats that Nikola
supports would be a PITA.  So, I wrote a &lt;a href="http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode"&gt;pretty simple plugin&lt;/a&gt; to
Nikola to support posting from org files.  And then with a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/6970578"&gt;little
Python&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to move everything over to use Nikola.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hopefully, I'll keep my blog more updated, from here on!

Well, as you can see, I've changed my blog a bit.  I had been
trying to make it gel well with org-mode and looking for ways to
allow me to share arbit stuff with separate feeds for tags,
separate pages with independent feeds, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I finally got around to tweaking the code of reprise to be able to
do this.  There are still a few things I would like to change, but
I'll make the changes gradually.  The looks are also straight from
uddigal's reprise, with a few tiny tweaks.  I hope it is alright
to be using it.  I really liked the theme.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Every tag now has a separate feed. &lt;code&gt;/tags/emacs.atom&lt;/code&gt; will give
you the feed of &lt;code&gt;emacs&lt;/code&gt; for instance. Also, I plan to have a
couple of more pages, one for all the interesting links I come
across and another for interesting quotes.  Both of these pages,
have their own feeds too (&lt;code&gt;quotes.atom&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;links.atom&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the spirit of minimalism, I got rid of comments.  I've been
looking for ways of having comments without all the javascript
cruft from disqus, but I didn't find any satisfactory way to do
this.  So, the site will have no comments.  You can write to me,
in case you've something to say to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Adios.

A couple of days back.. one guy called green&lt;sub&gt;mamba&lt;/sub&gt; asked me.. "Why
do you use Linux (GNU/Linux) and not Windows? What is it that
makes LinuxGNU/Linux] so special for you?" I avoided that
question then.. {I was in no mood of answering questions… Exams
had finished just the day before!!}  I am trying to answer it
now… green&lt;sub&gt;mamba&lt;/sub&gt; also told me that Roopesh said, "I use it
because I can look at the source code. I am allowed to look at how
things work and fiddle with the way they work!"… I knew it
immediately that this was not the reason for me.[I rarely looked
at source code… and making changes to it.. haha..] So what is
it? I think I can answer this question if I get back to the time
when I started using Linux…[hehe.. not too long ago!! :P]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So how did I start using GNU/Linux? How did "we" first meet? It
was during last summer holidays.. that Voods sent me this link
… [I had definitely used GNU/Linux on a few occasions
before… but.. this was when I really began using it…] and
within hours I was a fan of GNU/Linux!![and Richard M Stallman
(RMS)]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So its the "philosophy"… The philosophy of Free
Software… [Free as in Freedom, not as in Free Beer…(English is
a wierd wierd Language…)]… The philosophy of Open
Source… that brought me to it… This song says it the best…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
Free Software Song –RMS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Join us now and share the software;&lt;br&gt;
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Hoarders may get piles of money,&lt;br&gt;
That is true, hackers, that is true.&lt;br&gt;
But they cannot help their neighbors;&lt;br&gt;
That's not good, hackers, that's not good.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When we have enough free software&lt;br&gt;
At our call, hackers, at our call,&lt;br&gt;
We'll throw out those dirty licenses&lt;br&gt;
Ever more, hackers, ever more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Join us now and share the software;&lt;br&gt;
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
now I continue to use it.. for a variety of reasons..[they are NOT
in the order of their priority/importance]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, using Linux gives me a sense of community… a sense of
oneness [this can't happen with Windows.. because you can't
share stuff… :-(]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have begun to hate the concept of Proprietary Software… can
you believe that.. "Sharing stuff..  makes us PIRATES!!"
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I am a growing fan of the Command Line… It simply rocks!!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There's almost no problem of Viruses/Malware.. You simply don't
need an Anti-Virus..(that needs to be updated every night.. or
u'll have nightmares…)
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Then there's this wonderful concept of Live-CDs.. {specially
Knoppix.. Its absolutely awesome!} It put me(us?) out of
soup… a lotta times…
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The fiddle factor… I have just started to fiddle with
things(…source codes… I added a small feature to my
dc-client Microdc2].. the feature of away messages.. it feels
gr8! :P)
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;One of my best friend is using it too! [you know who…]
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Mascot looks cool!! ;) [I liked the GNU mascot too! (It's on
my side-bar) ]
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The name "LINUX"!! [There's so many flavors(Distros) of
Linux.. that I can keep trying different ones.. all my
life :P.. presently with Slackware!]
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Its Fun!! and I want to use it…
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;and finally… Windows sucks! [I don't have to use it… :P]!!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Value your freedom or you will lose it, teaches history. "Don't
bother us with politics," respond those who don't want to learn.
–Richard Stallman
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When you say, "I wrote a program that crashed Windows", people
just stare at you blankly and say, "Hey, I got those with the
system, for free".  –Linus Torvalds
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"What happens when you read some doc and either it doesn't answer
 your question or is demonstrably wrong? In Linux, you say "Linux
 sucks" and go read the code. In Windows/Oracle/etc you say
 "Windows sucks" and start banging your head against the wall."
 — Denis Vlasenko on linux kernel mailing list
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"The box said that I needed to have Windows 98 or better… so I
installed Linux."  – LinuxNewbie.org
