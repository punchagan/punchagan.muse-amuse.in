These days my strolls, in the blog-o-sphere, have grown manifold
both in their numbers and lengths. And with every passing
step… self doubts mount up. I begin to wonder if my blogs even
worth its w8 in 'seconds'. Like the thousands of others in this
world, I could post something in one of these genres but..
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Techno Blog. [On various latest hardware, softwares, gadgets et
al..] But I ain't a geek to be able to post such stuff. If I
ever posted something of this genre.. it would just be a
copy-paste job.. isn't of any great value, given the readership
of my blog.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scientific Blog. [With the latest advances in various
disciplines of Science] Again a case similar to the previous
one. Not of much use
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literary Blog.[Stories n Poems n other Creations.] I ain't a
creative being and rarely indulge in such creative acts. Would
be foolish
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PhotoBlog.[Creative Pics/Paintings, Worthy of Display] I own no
camera and don't borrow one too often. Also haven't got a very
Creative eye to capture magic from the ordinary. Un-healthy
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily Diary. [An account of my day-to-day tidings] My life ain't
overflowing with adventures. I am presently leading a
non-adventurous, pretty monotonous life that would be
uninteresting to readers of all classes. Ruled out for the lack
of utility.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current-affairs Blog. [An account of today's, this week's
happenings] Not interested in being a Journalist, there's
already lotsa people who can handle the job better.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humour Blog. [Laugh and Let Laugh!] Again there's a lot of it
already online, and with a sense of humour like mine, the
difference made would be Nought.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspirational Blog. [Inspire others to do their best.] Its
pointless preaching what I don't practice. That would be
hypocrisy.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Blog. [Any info possibly..from pet-care to ethnic
goan recipes…] I haven't yet crammed in so much into the
super-computer on my top-floor to beat Google.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Mixed Bag. [Posts of multiple genres] Impossible. The bag's
already empty for every item of it has already been ruled out.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Do I still need a BLOG?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
ps: Prevention of boredom-induced-insanity is the one and only
genuine reason(known to me) for the continued existence of my
blog.

I am beginning to notice something about my posts [ok.. there
aren't many that make it here.. :P] There are sometimes, when I
feel I should write about a specific thing. I feel as if, there
has to be a post about this, and there's no way I can't write
about it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But then I have limited access to net here… and even less time
when I'm alone, to write up something. I definitely cannot access
net immediately, whenever I get that 'feel' to write about
something. So the post is postponed…  And later, when I think
about it, or do get access to net… it seems that topic isn't
worth writing.. or that 'feel' isn't there anymore..
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wonder if this would have been the case with my other posts
too.. if only I waited longer to post them?? [But on reading some
of the older posts I don't feel so much that way…] Am I being
lazy?? [Is this how other blogs die down?] Is it that my life is
dull and boring here (if it was so bad.. I guess I would've
managed to write about boredom! :P).. and there's nothing worth
writing? [and I am just thinking of something to keep my blog
alive?]  Is my blog closer to its end than it is to its beginning?
[I don't think so.. its only a matter of time before I get back to
coll.. :P] But is it the best way to be posting
[instinctively… immediately]??? Or is there something better
that I should be learning.. that I should have learnt by now??
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
BTW.. why do people blog at all?? What's the whole point of
Blogging? [Yes, I haven't still understood what it is.. even after
about 30 posts…]
&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><category>blab</category><category>posts</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/posts.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2007 14:44:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Second Blog...</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/a-second-blog.html</link><description>&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can't really be called a Second Blog… because I won't be
posting any new stuff there…
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I just started it to have a Wordpress experience…
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started it to know.. to compare… and to choose…
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started it just for fun…
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started it because Blogspot may soon be blocked on campus!!!
&lt;/li&gt;
