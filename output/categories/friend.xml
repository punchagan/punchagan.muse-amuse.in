The ripples on the quiet lake,&lt;br&gt;
twinkling stars on a moonless night,&lt;br&gt;
and his lonely, crazy, thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
yet again, his faithful companions&lt;br&gt;
on another of those countless nights,&lt;br&gt;
searching for meaning, awaiting the dawn.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the night crawled by, as he drifted afloat,&lt;br&gt;
memories of the past and dreams of the future,&lt;br&gt;
until approaching footsteps, brought him back&lt;br&gt;
did the chill of the wind, get to his head?&lt;br&gt;
or was his guarded secret, not his anymore?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Before his thoughts, collect, he could,&lt;br&gt;
his friend, from far away lands unknown,&lt;br&gt;
was there with him, to share his thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
to hear the wind hum the tunes of yore,&lt;br&gt;
while the stars and the lake, as a duo, danced.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They watch the sun rise, from atop the hillock,&lt;br&gt;
basking in the warmth, and see the town wake up,&lt;br&gt;
lose themselves in the woods below,&lt;br&gt;
on their way back, rest by the lake shore,&lt;br&gt;
watching it, silently, shine in the daylight,&lt;br&gt;
letting it wet their feet and clear his head.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Together, they cook themselves, a delicious meal,&lt;br&gt;
n enjoy it, with some of the choicest old wine.&lt;br&gt;
Catch-up on things, and yearn for more, discuss&lt;br&gt;
all the many things, under the sun, and over,&lt;br&gt;
without a clue, as to how much time flew by.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Riding away, as fast as they could, they reach,&lt;br&gt;
just in time, as the sun set, over the seas,&lt;br&gt;
perched on bicycles, in mirrored positions, with&lt;br&gt;
resonating thoughts, the horizon, they watch&lt;br&gt;
the sun set, the beach light up, and the fair begin.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They ate and drank, sung and danced and&lt;br&gt;
just had a good time, for the rest of the night,&lt;br&gt;
indulging, in all that the fair could offer.&lt;br&gt;
the night was long, but if wouldn't go on forever,&lt;br&gt;
pretty well, they knew, they day was to end.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the twinkling stars they watched, yet again,&lt;br&gt;
but to the sea's song, on the still warm sand&lt;br&gt;
slowly, but steadily, into sleep he drifted,&lt;br&gt;
only to be awake, moments later, with the&lt;br&gt;
bright sun coming harshly down upon him,&lt;br&gt;
lighting up the lake, like a carpet of jewels.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
all he had, once again, were just his thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
the lake, and not the sea, by his side,&lt;br&gt;
with fading impressions of an impossible dream&lt;br&gt;
after all, wasn't it just too much action,&lt;br&gt;
for just one day, for a life engulfed by ennui?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One some day, he told himself, and walked away.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
