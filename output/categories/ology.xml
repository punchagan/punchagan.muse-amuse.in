If you are new to &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, you should probably stop reading here.
But, if you have used &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt;, then read on. Before, that
try these bits of code.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;

&lt;pre class="src src-python"&gt;import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2])
a = a + 0.5j
print a
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The "same thing", in a slightly different way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;

&lt;pre class="src src-python"&gt;import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2])
a += 0.5j
print a
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Both the code blocks, look really the same, until you look carefully.
Under normal circumstances &lt;code&gt;a = a + b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a += b&lt;/code&gt; behave exactly
similarly, and we really don't need to bother about the differences
between them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt;, which is an augmented assignment operator, actually tries
to perform the operation in-place, unlike the other statement where
&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; actually returns a new object which is again being referenced by
the name &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, when dealing with &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; arrays, this will lead to trouble.
When assigning to an array, it's &lt;code&gt;dtype&lt;/code&gt; is not changed and hence the
trouble.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The right way to use the augmented assignment operator, would be:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;

&lt;pre class="src src-python"&gt;import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2], dtype=complex)
a += 0.5j
print a
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The same thing is explained in this thread.  Also, Thanks to
Bhanukiran for asking me this.

I now have a GNU! I bought it (a GNU soft toy) in memory of my friend
swathanthran from #emacs-in.  RIP swathanthran
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a bonus, I got the chance to have a photograph with just RMS and
me. Also, hoping the monetary contribution will be of some use to
FSF-India.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The thrill of getting the GNU (and the GNU itself) and shaking hands,
getting photographed with RMS is dedicated to all the lafoots and
specially to Voodoo, who taught me the meaning of the word "hacker".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Happy Hacking!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
ps: I just hope and pray nobody else does anything as stupid and
shocking as what swathanthran did.

Well, it's been a week of lull on my blog.  Not that I'm very
busy.  But, just didn't have anything to post.  I was feeling jobless
today and searched the web for org2blog users.  Here is what I found.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a test post from org2blog
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Posting from emacs and org-mode
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Vim vs Emacs, or why it really doesn’t matter
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Posting subtree from org-mode buffer (take 2)
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Here’s a test post to wordpress for Org2blog – an Emacs plugin
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Primeiro post usando org2blog
&lt;/li&gt;

 For the uninitiated, vimperator is an emacs plugin to get Firefox
working with vim keybindings and firemacs &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/vimperator-and-firemacs.html#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is for emacs keybindings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm obsessed with emacs (as should already be evident) and can't
really edit text without it's key-bindings. There are others like me,
and hence the firemacs plugin. It's a blessing for my tribe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Firemacs is great, except for the one great feature that it lacks -
being able to jump to links/textareas without using the mouse.  I've
seen Nishanth do it with ease, using Vimperator. I wanted to add this
feature to Firemacs, by copying some code from Vimperator to
Firemacs.  I directly started looking at the code, but couldn't make
head or tail of it. I got a few doubts about how Vimperator works,
since I'd never used it. Nishanth asked me to simply install it and
try it out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And then we had our EUREKA! moment. Vimperator and Emacs both
enabled together work seamlessly well. Two obsessed people are happy
and satisfied! And hopefully many more. :D
&lt;/p&gt;

Key-bindings are a religious thing, in the world of editors!

&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;What is 'Sage Days'?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sage Days is a confluence of present and prospective SAGE Users and
Developers. It is an opportunity to come together to share ideas,
brainstorm and hack on Sage. Sage Days 25 is the 25th version of Sage
Days, and is being organized in Mumbai, India. In order to cater to an
Indian audience and scenario, this version has been tweaked
slightly. Sage Days 25 has beginner level tutorials, in addition to
the usual talks and sprints, to help new users get started with Sage
and help promote the use of Sage in India.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;What is Sage?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sage is a free, open-source mathematics software system licensed under
the GPL. It combines the power of numerous existing open-source
packages into a common Python-based interface. It's mission is to
create a "viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab". Sage has tools for a broad range of
mathematical areas like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Symbolic Math,
Plotting, Rings &amp;amp; Groups, Graph Theory, Number Theory and
Cryptography. Essentially, "it can do anything from mapping a
12-dimensional object to calculating rainfall patterns under global
warming" - as Science Daily puts it . Eager to get started? Start
here. Apart from being feature rich, it's usability is one of it's
greatest strengths. Sage Notebook, a web-interface for all the math
you'll ever want to do, is really the killer feature! As the Sage
Marketing page says, "The SAGE GUI surely works on your computer box,
because it just runs in Firefox!". Try it Now!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;Why should you attend?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sage Days 25 is being attended by the creator and lead developer of
Sage, Prof. William Stein. It will also be attended by other
developers of Sage. This would be a great opportunity to meet and
interact with them! The conference will be attended by a plethora of
enthusiastic people from all over the country who use Sage or are
interested in doing so. The conference will also see the presence of
many mathematicians interested in software. Who knows, you may run
into someone you'd want to collaborate with, for your future work!
This event will be a great learning experience, if you are even
remotely interested in math and software for it!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Shantanu and I conducted a workshop on Scipy at GNUnify '10. It
was intended to be an introduction to Scipy and Numpy through
Image processing. We expected an audience which was python
literate. But GNUnify's schedule wasn't too favorable for us. Ours
was the first talk scheduled and we ended up getting people who
only "heard" of Python, the language.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We had planned quite a bit of stuff expecting a python literate
audience. But unfortunately, we had to start almost from scratch
and couldn't do all of what we planned. Still, the workshop wasn't
too bad. Nobody left mid-way during the 2 hour workshop; nobody
was dozing either.  I would have liked my first talk at a FOSS
event to be better, though.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Slides and Images that we used.  Shantanu's post on the talk is
here.

Like most bloggers, I keep looking at my blogs hits once in a
while. (Sometimes inspires to write better; and more often.) The
post that gets most hits these days is my post on mailman,
postfix, et al. But the search term that's increasingly bringing
people to my blog is "punchagan".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This scares me. What makes people search for me? What makes people
search more often these days? Why am I scared?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why do people use monikers or online identities? I started off
with the idea of anonymity and privacy; keeping my online identify
separate from my real one. But it, obviously, is a folly to have
you email id with the same handle. Now, almost anybody who knows
me, also knows my online handle. They can find me anywhere and
everywhere with just a few keystrokes (and Google). Also, the
uniqueness of my handle doesn't help one bit. Any search returns
over 90% relevant results.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is it time to get lost in the crowd with a new handle? ;) Probably
not. I don't have much to hide under the covers. Let the world see
– who I am, who I have been; where I am, where I have been.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Peace.

I'm now officially a part of the Arch Linux community! Arch Linux
is a lightweight and flexible Linux® distribution that tries to
Keep It Simple.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have started using arch from less than a week or so. It took me
a while, not too long, to realize the beauty of this distro. I was
trying to tweak the settings of my org-mode's remember (on
Karmic), trying to make it work the way I liked it. After breaking
my head with .emacs and lisp for a while, I realized the version
of my org-mode was way different from the version of the docs, I
was reading. It didn't take long to figure out, which version of
org-mode to get. As a matter of curiosity, I checked AUR for the
version, and true to Arch's reputation it was bleeding edge! I was
still using Karmic, since I hadn't got my Arch installation
working the way I like it, yet. Out of laziness. sudo reboot; to
hell with laziness!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was setting up things I regularly use, tweaking my way
around. After a day or so, I find python-numpy is out of date. And
to top it, an orphaned package! I didn't feel one bit good about
this. After some futile attempts to suppress my discomfort, I sat
down to work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After an afternoon of effort, I created my first PKGBUILD. :) I
now have python-numpy installed using pacman! Pleasure to join the
Arch User Community! Also, thanks to lifeeth and Lynus Vaz, for
the sparks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
PS: I'm using Arch with Openbox. It's neat! PPS: org-mode is
really awesome! It's a world in itself. life in plain text,
truly!]

&lt;i&gt;[Cross-posted on the FOSSEE Blog]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Don't tell me I didn't warn you, if you walk into our lab sometime
and mistake it for a game zone in your neighbourhood. You are
indeed in "the" lab. If you came looking for Prof. Prabhu you'll
have to return. You'll only find PR vowing to see the end of
baali, for having a nice time pawning him. You won't find me
around - I'm cloaked and busy creating havoc. Unless, of course,
you are the seer KD. Watch your step extremely carefully or you
won't know when and how fuchmed's GM hit you. And don't dare
venture anywhere near madrazr, jumping all around with a
shockwave, unless you are capable enjoying some real nasty
shocks. Well, the team is busy in one of it's two SB sessions per
day. SB (short for Stress Buster) sessions are intense 15 minute
rounds of bzflag - 3D first person tank battle game.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hope you didn't start thinking, I'm just goofing off here, doing
nothing at all. If it's not already clear, SB sessions are exactly
what they are called - Stress Busters. Just to refresh ourselves
and get back to work, with greater force. What then, am I doing
for the rest of my time?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mainly I've been developing course content that we have been
working on, called Software Tools, Techniques and Practices. I
have been working on a session for elementary LaTeX and basic
Linux tools. I've also been attending classes of Digital Control
and trying to Python-ize the Matlab/Scilab code that the course
uses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, that's not all. I've helped a guy restore a Joomla site on
Day-1. I screwed up a brand new installation of a server with some
real skill; then expect to be screwed but get some encouragement
with the words, "It was a good learning experience for us." Seen a
Debian server upgrade from Etch to Lenny in under 10
minutes. Installed an instance of twiki and struggled to configure
it. Helped a Humanities Scholar with LaTeX. Attended a workshop on
Instruction Design. Restored Qmail on an old Fedora 3
server. Goofed around in gimp, for a CD cover and a T-shirt
design. Chipped in with bits, for mutating Ubuntu into
"LivePython". Did a bit of css and javascript tweaking… The list
goes on!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, don't you think we deserve the SB's? ;)
&lt;/p&gt;</description><author></author><category>blab</category><category>ology</category><category>stress</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/stress-and-us.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2009 03:36:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Postfix + Mailman for Multiple Domains.</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/postfix-mailman-for-multiple-domains.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;
Well, there are a hazaar tutorials on setting up Postfix and
Mailman for Debian for a single domain. There were a few for doing
that for multiple domains also, but nothing comprehensive, if I
could say so. This link is pretty comprehensive and details all
the steps for setting up Postfix for a single domain.  Here is all
you'll want to know about setting up Virtual domains in Postfix.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You only need to make a few changes for adding a second (or more)
domain. You just need to add the &lt;code&gt;virtual_alias_domains&lt;/code&gt; and add
&lt;code&gt;virtual_alias_maps&lt;/code&gt;. Here is a glimpse of how my &lt;code&gt;main.cf&lt;/code&gt; looks:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;
myhostname = mail.abc.in
mydomain = abc.in
mydestination = $myhostname, $mydomain, localhost.$mydomain
myorigin = /etc/mailname
virtual_alias_maps =
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-xyz,
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-abc,
                hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/virtual-mailman
virtual_alias_domains = xyz.in, mail.xyz.in
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;virtual-xyz&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;virtual-abc&lt;/code&gt; contain the virtual aliases for
each domain. Note that Postfix expects hash files and hence you
need to run &lt;code&gt;postmap /etc/postfix/virtual-abc&lt;/code&gt; each
time the file is changed, to keep the hash file in sync with the
text file that you edit. Also, you need to run &lt;code&gt;postfix reload&lt;/code&gt;,
each time you make changes to &lt;code&gt;main.cf&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;master.cf&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fairly straight forward, right? But it took me quite sometime to
get it all right, since this was the first time I was doing
anything with Mail Transfer Agents or the like.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, onto Mailman. Well the Installation Manual of Mailman,
literally has it all. Here is a look at how my
&lt;code&gt;mm_cfg.py&lt;/code&gt; looks:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;
DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST = 'abc.in'
DEFAULT_URL_HOST   = 'mail.abc.in'
add_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)
POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS=['xyz.in']
add_virtualhost('mail.xyz.in', 'xyz.in')
MTA='Postfix'
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The only trouble was to get mailing lists with same names on both
the domains (which I couldn't get working). I experimented with
multiple mailman instances but that won't work because the MTA
can't differentiate between the two instances of mailman. The
alternative is probably to have two instances of postfix running
too. But that I felt was like going too far, and gave up. [What if
we wanted to add another domain to the list?!]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also, I had to make a few alterations to the Apache file to allow
access to the mailman pages without breaking the Zope redirection
that was already set-up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[Thanks to Shantanu and Vattam (and all the hazaar people using
Postfix and Mailman and cared to document things for the sake of
others, and of course Google)]
