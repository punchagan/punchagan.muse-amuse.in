The ripples on the quiet lake,&lt;br&gt;
twinkling stars on a moonless night,&lt;br&gt;
and his lonely, crazy, thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
yet again, his faithful companions&lt;br&gt;
on another of those countless nights,&lt;br&gt;
searching for meaning, awaiting the dawn.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the night crawled by, as he drifted afloat,&lt;br&gt;
memories of the past and dreams of the future,&lt;br&gt;
until approaching footsteps, brought him back&lt;br&gt;
did the chill of the wind, get to his head?&lt;br&gt;
or was his guarded secret, not his anymore?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Before his thoughts, collect, he could,&lt;br&gt;
his friend, from far away lands unknown,&lt;br&gt;
was there with him, to share his thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
to hear the wind hum the tunes of yore,&lt;br&gt;
while the stars and the lake, as a duo, danced.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They watch the sun rise, from atop the hillock,&lt;br&gt;
basking in the warmth, and see the town wake up,&lt;br&gt;
lose themselves in the woods below,&lt;br&gt;
on their way back, rest by the lake shore,&lt;br&gt;
watching it, silently, shine in the daylight,&lt;br&gt;
letting it wet their feet and clear his head.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Together, they cook themselves, a delicious meal,&lt;br&gt;
n enjoy it, with some of the choicest old wine.&lt;br&gt;
Catch-up on things, and yearn for more, discuss&lt;br&gt;
all the many things, under the sun, and over,&lt;br&gt;
without a clue, as to how much time flew by.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Riding away, as fast as they could, they reach,&lt;br&gt;
just in time, as the sun set, over the seas,&lt;br&gt;
perched on bicycles, in mirrored positions, with&lt;br&gt;
resonating thoughts, the horizon, they watch&lt;br&gt;
the sun set, the beach light up, and the fair begin.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They ate and drank, sung and danced and&lt;br&gt;
just had a good time, for the rest of the night,&lt;br&gt;
indulging, in all that the fair could offer.&lt;br&gt;
the night was long, but if wouldn't go on forever,&lt;br&gt;
pretty well, they knew, they day was to end.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the twinkling stars they watched, yet again,&lt;br&gt;
but to the sea's song, on the still warm sand&lt;br&gt;
slowly, but steadily, into sleep he drifted,&lt;br&gt;
only to be awake, moments later, with the&lt;br&gt;
bright sun coming harshly down upon him,&lt;br&gt;
lighting up the lake, like a carpet of jewels.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
all he had, once again, were just his thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
the lake, and not the sea, by his side,&lt;br&gt;
with fading impressions of an impossible dream&lt;br&gt;
after all, wasn't it just too much action,&lt;br&gt;
for just one day, for a life engulfed by ennui?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One some day, he told himself, and walked away.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

the time, together spent,&lt;br&gt;
the memories cherished,&lt;br&gt;
all the love, concern and care&lt;br&gt;
may they stay with us, for life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
as high and far as you like&lt;br&gt;
may you fly, like you own the sky&lt;br&gt;
while I fumble, with my flying guide&lt;br&gt;
I see the world, through your eyes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
may you run, with all your might&lt;br&gt;
as if, fighting for life, you are.&lt;br&gt;
struggling to walk, I stumble and fall,&lt;br&gt;
but get up each time, inspired to run.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
may you, in all that we shared&lt;br&gt;
find strength to go on, if en-route&lt;br&gt;
our paths diverged; you may have to wait,&lt;br&gt;
but you shall see me, on the other side!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to Chaitu, I re-read Love Unvoiced a few times and
realized, I was trying to say too much. Here's another poem,
with one part of what I wanted to say. I will not be writing
newer poems, to say the other stuff. Perform your own Fourier
analysis.

&lt;br&gt;
Hard, I tried, to stay mum,&lt;br&gt;
and keep it all within.&lt;br&gt;
But, not much longer can I stand,&lt;br&gt;
I give in, and here's my song&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
wherever you are, anywhere you go,&lt;br&gt;
whatever you do, or choose not to,&lt;br&gt;
whatever you think and however you feel,&lt;br&gt;
my love for you, it shall only grow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sweet, is the attachment,&lt;br&gt;
but let it not keep you from flying.&lt;br&gt;
the clear open sky, it's all yours&lt;br&gt;
fly! fly! fly!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
see all that you want to,&lt;br&gt;
and do all that you'd like to.&lt;br&gt;
to your hearts content, fly!&lt;br&gt;
without a care in the world, fly!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
for, if ever, you wish to rest,&lt;br&gt;
now you know, where to return&lt;br&gt;
right here, I shall be,&lt;br&gt;
with love, just a little more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Mute, I chose to be, but, boy!&lt;br&gt;
does it need to be told. All over me,&lt;br&gt;
it's written; and you, sure, read me!&lt;br&gt;
Love you, for being the more loving one!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

I'm not the body that dies&lt;br&gt;
on missing a beat or one breath.&lt;br&gt;
I'm not the mind, so fickle,&lt;br&gt;
I'm in heaven one moment, and next in hell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm the moments I live,&lt;br&gt;
not the ones, in which I just exist.&lt;br&gt;
I'm the dreams I dream,&lt;br&gt;
those fulfilled, and not just yet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am the occasions I grace&lt;br&gt;
and those, missed, where I am.&lt;br&gt;
I am the words I spoke,&lt;br&gt;
those I wrote, and those I will.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am all that I create,&lt;br&gt;
and the stuff that I catalyse.&lt;br&gt;
I am the love I receive,&lt;br&gt;
and all of it that I spread.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Don't cry, when I die,&lt;br&gt;
for I never really will.&lt;br&gt;

Come spring -&lt;br&gt;
a fresh lease of green&lt;br&gt;
drapes the bare branches.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The leaves, dancing and whistling&lt;br&gt;
to the tunes of the wind&lt;br&gt;
playing, screaming, and singing,&lt;br&gt;
in each other's company, enjoying.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Singing to one another&lt;br&gt;
promises of sticking together,&lt;br&gt;
come what may, through it all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The song goes on,&lt;br&gt;
but the count goes down,&lt;br&gt;
not noticed or just unacknowledged,&lt;br&gt;
first by one and then by many more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the song, still, goes on.&lt;br&gt;
And the promises too, of course.&lt;br&gt;
The song goes on and on and on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Until silence falls upon, when all&lt;br&gt;
of them are gone. The tree, knowing well,&lt;br&gt;
watches on - it won't be long before&lt;br&gt;
a new bunch springs up to sing the song.&lt;br&gt;

Achieve something, I'm often reminded,&lt;br&gt;
achieve something, something that's worthwhile.&lt;br&gt;
Don't just kill time, they say,&lt;br&gt;
for, brutally, it shall kill you someday.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Make the best use of time, I tell myself,&lt;br&gt;
for I realize, how I spend my days&lt;br&gt;
is how I'm spending my life and&lt;br&gt;
I'm going to get just one of it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But, what is worthwhile, I wonder&lt;br&gt;
everything seems so good one moment&lt;br&gt;
and all meaning vanishes the very next.&lt;br&gt;
I'm utterly confused, somebody help!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Pick one from, spoke my brother,&lt;br&gt;
the 'everything' that seems good&lt;br&gt;
and do it right, just, do it right!&lt;br&gt;
Life, as you live through it, shall&lt;br&gt;
teach you to do things that are right&lt;br&gt;
and at the end of it all, you'll&lt;br&gt;
never regret what you've done&lt;br&gt;
but, only what you couldn't!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

dead and lifeless, in a box I lie&lt;br&gt;
just my size, to be buried deep somewhere,&lt;br&gt;
arranged with flowers, bright and fragrant&lt;br&gt;
more alive than dead, are they&lt;br&gt;
the final goodbye I have said,&lt;br&gt;
gone am I, never to return–but&lt;br&gt;
who am I, who am I, who am I?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
am I –&lt;br&gt;
the knowledge I arduously gained,&lt;br&gt;
from all the books I read and re-read.&lt;br&gt;
the wealth and riches I made,&lt;br&gt;
at the cost of sweat, often also blood.&lt;br&gt;
the skill with utmost care I groomed,&lt;br&gt;
for that, today, has me world-renowned.&lt;br&gt;
the numerous battles I braved,&lt;br&gt;
where win or loss never, only a fight mattered.&lt;br&gt;
all those dreams I dared to dream,&lt;br&gt;
and the goals I never, or have, reached.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
None of it, I realised, am I,&lt;br&gt;
but, who am I, who am I, who am I&lt;br&gt;
deep and loud, for one last time I wonder&lt;br&gt;
"the difference, you make to the world,&lt;br&gt;
is who you are", my Master answered,&lt;br&gt;
"Life's fragrance is in service,&lt;br&gt;
it grows and unfurls, far and wide,&lt;br&gt;
long after you are lifeless and dead"&lt;br&gt;

A hug so deep,&lt;br&gt;
resting on him the Christ,&lt;br&gt;
isn't just etched&lt;br&gt;
unto flesh of my chest,&lt;br&gt;
but my heart bathes,&lt;br&gt;
in the beauty of His love.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A close embrace,&lt;br&gt;
not a speck moves,&lt;br&gt;
the winds stand still,&lt;br&gt;
while my mind soars,&lt;br&gt;
above the skies,&lt;br&gt;
across the blues,&lt;br&gt;
within and without.&lt;br&gt;

On a day, Wonderful,&lt;br&gt;
'm filled with emotion&lt;br&gt;
inexpressible&lt;br&gt;
for, I think of&lt;br&gt;
all that we share.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On a day that's Special,&lt;br&gt;
for the World,&lt;br&gt;
not just yet may be,&lt;br&gt;
my heart rejoices&lt;br&gt;
in the light you fill me with.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On a day, epochal&lt;br&gt;
I just hope, you enjoy&lt;br&gt;
all that the World's given&lt;br&gt;
and celebrate for&lt;br&gt;
all the difference you make&lt;br&gt;
in the World of some.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On this day,&lt;br&gt;
overwhelmed, with lots to convey,&lt;br&gt;
silence, I choose,&lt;br&gt;
for, it speaks louder than words.&lt;br&gt;
I just say,&lt;br&gt;
Happy Birthday, mate.&lt;br&gt;

This is a free world,&lt;br&gt;
you are free to will and whim,&lt;br&gt;
can it, at the cost of,&lt;br&gt;
your brother n his freedom,be?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Life is price'less',&lt;br&gt;
the big shots say, we realize.&lt;br&gt;
is it why, you sell ya brethren's life,&lt;br&gt;
cheaply, for personal gain?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The human'kind', we call ourselves,&lt;br&gt;
aren't the rivers, the air,&lt;br&gt;
the forests or our mother earth,&lt;br&gt;
worthy of our acts of kindness?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We are making rapid strides,&lt;br&gt;
from the micro to the nano,&lt;br&gt;
is it just in sci &amp;amp;amp; tech, or does&lt;br&gt;
it coop in our loves and lives too?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The world's a small place,&lt;br&gt;
the wise and learned say,&lt;br&gt;
is that why, not all have,&lt;br&gt;
a roof, under which to stay?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Its a world of press n media,&lt;br&gt;
is it why we are pressed at,&lt;br&gt;
with news that's dubious,&lt;br&gt;
in truth and worth as well?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We are all for world peace, they say,&lt;br&gt;
do you alone, make up "the world"? I ask&lt;br&gt;
How else would war, uncalled for&lt;br&gt;
bring about world peace?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I want my piece is all I hear.&lt;br&gt;
