This post is my attempt to start a travelogue. I hope to capture
the "All India Tour" phase of my life (as people have started to
call it).  I'll try to keep these posts from becoming travel
guides. There are loads of them and I surely don't need to
increment count.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post is after a trip to Kanpur, Agra and Sikri.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trains are never on Time. The delay increases exponentially with
your distance from the sourthern most tip of the country. Also,
the confidence of the aam admi in this delay is proportional to
the distance. Any delay less than an hour wasn't considered to
be a delay. Thanks to the fog, low visibility.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to travel around India, all you need is an
SLR. Additionally, if you are not of Indian origin, you'll need
the "India" guide. I got bored of seeing people poring over the
pages of that "blue" India book or madly clicking away on their
SLRs.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether or not you get food or water on a train, you are assured
of enough "chilled" air from the slit under your window. Come
what may, you shall not be deprived of this service.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trust of a person in you is inversely proportional to the
difference between your ages. It is inversely proportional to
the 2.718th power of the difference if you are aged between 20
and 25. I only vaguely remember what the TTE told me in my
sleep, while paying the fine for not carrying a print out of our
e-ticket; but, it really was something sick and senseless.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chill at a place, on the day you reach, is inversely
proportional to how much people have scared/warned you. On the
rest of the days, it is proportional to the square of the warm
clothing you have on you. I thoroughly enjoyed the chill of
Kanpur. Wonderful! The infrastructure, too good! Never expected
a 50 year old campus to be so Awesome. [They have an air-strip
too!]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thrill of having an ice-cream is proportional to the square
of difference between the ambient temperature and the standard
room temperature.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't ever think of celebrating your escape, without the Aalu
encounter. Welcome to the land of Alu addicted men. You shall,
surely, have your share. If not anything else, you shall be
serverd a Capsicum or Brinjal stuffed with Aalu. Also, the
quality and availability of leather seems to be proportional to
the addiction to Aalu.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"hawker time" - the time you spend being followed by hawkers
trying to convince you to buy whatever they
have. "firang-ness" - difficult to predict; a parameter that
depends on the amount of branded stuff on you, stylishness of
your winter wear and other unknown variableness. Your hawker
time is proportional to (firang-ness) \* abs(time of day in 24
hr clock - 1400) [when, 900 &amp;lt; time &amp;lt; 1800] I understand, that,
they need to make ends meet; each day of their lives. I got
followed a lot. I can't help observing. Sometimes, enjoyed being
followed too.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Taj. Simply Awe-Inspiring. As Madhu put it, "the longer you
keep watching it, the more it's beauty overwhelms you". But, I
still think, the first time is the best time to see it. It's
simply mind blowing when you get the first glimpse, after entering
from the West gate.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's time to stop writing when all you can see is proportionality
between totally unrelated things.  Here are a few pics

This post's been inspired by a wonderful book, "A Byte of
Python"&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/a-byte-of-python.html#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by Swaroop C H. The book has been revised after a
gap of nearly 4 years and the wait is worth it! I thoroughly loved
the book, and I'm happy to be accompanied by so many&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/a-byte-of-python.html#fn.2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
others&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/a-byte-of-python.html#fn.3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This book has filled me with a sense of joy and
pride. The pride, of being part of such a wonderful community, a
beautiful crowd. Further, it is a matter of pride, the book's been
authored by an Indian - its quite rare to find such books written
by people in this part of the world.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have loved python, the moment I started using it. There are
quite a few occasions, where I did something, just because I had
the power of Python with me. Python is undoubtedly amongst the
best, not just as a first programming language, but to give the
user a sense of "do-able-ity" and I am thoroughly enjoying it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
&lt;/pre&gt;
