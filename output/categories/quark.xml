Back again with another khichdi of a post.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quark, Waves and Apogee. [For the uninitiated, Quark is our
technical festival and Waves, our Cul-fest] I had been to
BITS-Pilani, for attending their Tech-fest, Apogee.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One would expect Apogee to end up the best, but we were
thoroughly disappointed. It came nowhere near the perfection
of Quark and things seemed quite unprofessional. Hats-off to
Chaitu n others in the Quark Org-Co. I'm already worried
about missing Quark'09 [thanks to my PS]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The specials at all three events were unforgettable. Feeding
the Fish, the Air Shows (Naval and Amateur planes), the
Orchestral performance, Special Performance [Aasra], Sand
art by Gagan and Mithali!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had the opportunity, to meet/have a look at some of the guys
studying at colleges in their home towns. For once, I felt
being in a "reputed", national college does matter.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Felt good spending some time with good ol' friends at
Pilani.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always believed organizing events isn't my forte, but,
helped organize a couple of events at Quark. Feels good.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective Communication is less about how well you choose
your words but more about your quantum of concern for the
other person and the matter at hand!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pilani Campus, Love at First sight. Never really felt like
coming back.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The arts/non-technical clubs there are simply superb! We
have a lot to learn
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cycling on campus. A dream come true!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Night Canteen is a real hangout place!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green, Greener, Greenest. Never really felt like we were in
the deserts of Rajasthan.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…. the list can go on and on. I'll stop here.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;FOSS n me.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended my first FOSS event! The Install Fest @
Quark. Wasn't as awe inspiring as I would've liked it to be,
but still a memorable one. Simply for being my first
install-fest and for the lessons we learnt.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FOSSKriti'08 is one event I'll regret missing. It was
absolutely amazing. I'm just hoping, people here too get to
that level soon enough.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free Software and Freeware ain't the same stuff. It's
extremely painful when people address FOSS stuff as
freeware. Free Software is Software that's Free as in Free
Speech n Freeware is software that if free as in free beer.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eagerly awaiting mukt.in v2. Can't wait to get back home!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoying my time on \#mukt.in and \#linux-india. The new DC
hub (GNOME) for FOSS junta is cool too!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's an urgent need to start contributing to FOSS. But
how?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Haven't yet found myself an intern/project for summer. Wonder
what's in store, this summer.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the gang's On-Campus next sem. Will really miss Voodoo
though. Hoping he has a rocking PS.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hoping we won't have to shift hostels next sem.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciation is a great motivator. Expressing it promptly is
important. I'm bad at it. Should work on it.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The gang" is like a flock of birds in flight.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This semester is coming to an end already, and I don't have
anything I'd be proud of.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wonder why I have absolutely no feelings about the farewell we'd
be having soon.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awaiting Ugadi Celebs. Seems like they are gonna rock more than
ever.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gone are those days, when I used to post because something I had
to write about, compelled me to do so. These days, the long
inactivity on my blog is turning out to be the sole reason for
my posts. [A few Rare Exceptions though, and this one isn't] I
wonder if its because life's become uneventful or because I grew
lazier or because of something else.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't like posting accounts of events from the recent/distant
past, but I'm doing it just to prevent my blog's death.
&lt;/li&gt;

Another post, with nothing concrete to say…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are just a few random musings, for those curious about my
life and for the good health of my Blog which is so close to its
death..
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;College (+ Hostel) is amongst few places, that everyone on
Earth(&amp;amp; elsewhere) \*must\* get the chance to be in. There's a
whole new world out here, with hell a lotuva things you can do,
Here and Only Here… [I am not, by any means, talking of
acads!]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects. Yes they are a part of almost all my random
stuff… cos I just Love them, when they are self-assigned and
off-hand. They get even more exciting, when the learning curve
is Steep!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlines can be wonderful things, if only I learn to respect
them.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lab-Tests, i guess, are amongst the most hyped tests in the
World! They aren't worth all that fuss.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grades ain't everything in Life. Not even if you are doing
Engineering!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I live amidst /wonderful* singers, &lt;b&gt;marvelous&lt;/b&gt; music composers,
&lt;b&gt;facile&lt;/b&gt; lyric writers, &lt;b&gt;cool&lt;/b&gt; Hackers, &lt;b&gt;amazing&lt;/b&gt; photographers,
&lt;b&gt;inspiring&lt;/b&gt; poets and what not. [Why the hell do people then,
look just for the *"industrious"/ grade scorers?]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music and Sleep are Great Healers. Laughter, too, is a close
competitor.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU/Linux is addictive. More n more people getting addicted,
everyday!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RHCE's got a pretty interesting test. Its rare to be interested
in undergoing the torture of a test, ain't it?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rules seem to be total crap, until you get the chance to look at
them from above.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quark'08 coming up! Gottu gear up for it!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprees?? They don't bother me so much any more.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, for those who found all the above stuff boring and
dumb… here's some food for thought &amp;gt; The Best things in Life
aren't Things…
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Revelations..Revelations…Revelations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Such wonderful things they are… bringing to us.. such a joy
[even if its about something not so pleasant…]… the joy of
discovering things.. of realising a truth… that was hidden
somewhere within… brought out with an elegant swoooosh!!…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We, 9, Voodoo, Ravi, UC n me] were just walking on the
street… enjoying the evening… after a nice day @ Quark [Day
2]… We were having a casual discussion… not discussing
anything in particular… but somehow the discussion led to a
project uc,ravi n me [ and probably the others are too..(they
didn't talk abt it…)] are interested in… [i don't wanna give
any more info abt the project.. bcos it may seem over-ambitious to
a few.. not that it hasn't been done already…. but…]
neways….
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
so… while we were talkin abt it… uc said, he didn't have any
clue about that thing worked… and we all were wondering
too… thinking about some possible solutions/methods….[I was
actually trying to recollect something i came across… some time
back…] but then suddenly 9 jumped in, to say…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don't think about how 'that' works… Just think about how 'YOU'
would make it work!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Oh my God!! now that's what's a REVELATION… I was just
dumb-struck… that one small statement of his… drowned me in
its depths… I feel I still haven't come out of it… A big big
revelation at the most unexpected of times, at the most unexpected
of places…. [though 9 wouldn't agree with this… being his
usual modest self…]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Its been proved time and again… "they" can occur
anywhere… anytime and to anyone… while you are on the
street.. in your room.. at work… or even in the loo… [Most ppl
have a lot of them here!!].. we just need to keep our eyes n ears
open… and most importantly our Mind……  ps: it seems…me not
delving out the details about our ambitious project.. makes this
post a little vague, uninteresting n difficult to relate to… but
still…  In the fields of observation chance favors only the
prepared mind –Louis Pasteur
&lt;/p&gt;

This post is to promote QUARK'07… This post is here… little
due to my desire.. and almost totally bcos somebody [the ppl here
at coll..] expect "us" to do it..
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Blogspot.. Orkut..[i don't use it any more] were blocked on campus
[don't ask why cos none of us have been able to figure
out.. atleast about Blogspot..] but the blocks have been lifted
for a fortnight.. just so that we can publicise Quark [our
techfest..] Its from 17th March to 19th March.. check out the link
for more details..
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So ppl.. Quark coming up :)…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and… blocks coming up too :(…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[But why Blogspot???]
