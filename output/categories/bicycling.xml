I bought a new bike, about a month ago, and today was the first
longish ride on it.  Well, longish compared to my ~1.5km rides to
the office.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At 19:45, I just set out to get some fresh air.  After sitting for
two days, inside the house, by the evening on Sunday, I tend to
get stuffy.  I started riding westward and the fresh air got to my
head, I ended up pedaling too far away to get back, without going
to the beach.  It was fun, having adrenaline pumping all over.
But, there was much more traffic than I would've liked.  Anyway,
one shower on the way up, and one puncture on the way back
(thankfully, close enough to my house), it was a fun ride on the
whole.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I didn't time myself, but I roughly covered about 25 kms in say
about ~2 hours.  Hoping to start riding more frequently and going
on longer rides.
