Well, this isn't an update of how I'm doing on my sabbatical. Its
just been 3 days and I'm doing pretty fine.  I just finished
writing a script to keep my blogs page in sync with my
google-reader (well not exactly). The script parses an xml export
of my google-reader-subscriptions and updates the edits the html
of my unnought-blogs page. period.
</p>

<p>
There are a couple of things I don't like about this script.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, I don't want to keep exporting my
google-reader-subscription each time I make changes. The script
should be able to directly sync with my google-reader without me
having to export the file.  [I have read about the atom
subscriptions feed of Google Reader, but haven't been able to get
it right.] Hopefully, I'll be able to do it in the near future.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, The blog author's name is non-existent. I can't do
anything about this though.
</p>

<p>
Also, In the process, I had the chance to look a geeky ad. I found
it at the weirdest of places!

This post, is a different one in a couple of ways.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, I posted this from within emacs! I'm using the w3m
browser within emacs to post this. I've started using (trying to
use) emacs again. Hope to keep at it longer this time.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, I wish to inform junta about my sabbatical for a couple
of weeks. I have decided not to use IM/IRC/SocialNetworking sites
for the next couple of weeks. <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2008-07-06 Sun 00:00]</span></span>–[2008-07-19
Sat 23:59] I will, of course, be using mail and will also blog if
and when I feel like. This is an experiment triggered by a few
ideas from Chaitu<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="posts/a-sabbatical.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> and my own holiday lifestyle analysis. (Also
Chaitu has volunteered to join me.) Hope to make it through and
also get some valid, interesting results out of the experiment.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update:</b> Firemacs add-on for firfox is very useful. I couldn't
 get a decent browser for emacs that could open gmail, so I'm
 using Firefox with the Firemacs add-on to compose my mail. Its
 absolutely amazing. Believe me! [Jul 6, 2008]

I hadn't been much in the City for the past three years. I've had
a little trouble recollecting the exact routes and corresponding
bus numbers. I Googled for it, with little hope, and the results
didn't surprise me. There wasn't much info in this regard. On the
occasion of World Environment, when the focus is on promoting the
use of Public Transport, this isn't a very encouraging sign.
</p>

<p>
I was wondering if the Bus route info can somehow be integrated
with Google maps or the like. This will be a good thing to do,
since people who have access to internet (the higher rungs of the
society) are the ones who are most aware of the threats to the
Environment and also the ones who least use public transport. This
could help them do some planning and encourage use of public
transport. Later on, may be the Buses could have some kind of a
GPS sytem that could be interlinked with the maps, giving people
great power! I'm not sure if this already exists elsewhere in the
world, but seemed an interesting thing to do.
</p>

<p>
On a different note, just wanted to share this different
perspective my mom was giving to my 7 year old neice. We were on a
bus and my niece wasn't very happy about the crowd and the Bus
journey. My mom, then said something, probably to amuse the kid
and distract her for a while. But its an interesting way of
looking at things.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You should be proud that you are aboard a bus that costs around 15
lacs, something we wouldn't normally be able to buy. And that too
for a small sum of Rs. 5. You are being driven around by a
chauffeur employed by the State Govt. and you needn't bother
yourself with the routes and other headaches of driving you'd have
if you used your personal car…
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The kid wasn't convinced or even amused by this, but I liked the
interesting observation. Some food for thought, My mom travels for
an hour and half by bus to reach her work and she's been doing so
since I was a kid of 5 or 6. Now I know why she's been able to do
it for so many years, everyday!

Summer'08! I'm at home, doing nothing practically. :| No
Internships, No Projects, No GRE plans (a little pushing for GRE
has just started from the junta around.)
</p>

<p>
Just to kill some time and to learn some Python, I have begun to
write an IRC chat bot &amp;lt;lafoobot&amp;gt; [Lafoot + Bot]. The present
haven of lafoobot is #fosskelog @ irc.freenode.net. Join in, if
you want to have a chat! ;) Lafoobot can presently do very few
things
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Yoyo", a newly joined user
</li>
<li>"Hello"/ "Yoyo", a user or pass on a Hello/Yoyo from user to
another.
</li>
<li>Gives Local time / GMT
</li>
<li>Gives a random word and its meaning [put in for the junta
preparing for GRE ;)]
</li>
<li>Gives out an MOTD or a fortune when it first joins \#fosskelog
</li>
<li>Googles a search term and returns the top 5 results (This is my
favourite feature and this is the reason partially for this
post. "!google lafoobot" doesn't return anything. Hopefully not
anymore.)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you have ideas for any other features or if you want to have a
look at the source, comment here or join #fosskelog. lafoobot's
code is licensed under GPLv2!
</p>

<p>
Other than this, the summer has been relatively uneventful but for
the two FOSS events I attended. Yes, two events, Sat and Sun, both
by Twincling (There are two different Twinclings! Don't ask me
why) Hoping to have some more action this summer!
</p>

<p>
PS: There's a Big discussion presently on whether lafoobot is a he
or a she. ;) What do you think?

I was travelling in a bus today, when I overheard two people
sitting behind me. One of the guy was telling the other about his
brother's job and the hardships he faces. The guy they were
talking about, practically risks his life, to be able to eat a
square meal. He works on Billboards, used to paint them and now
that there aren't enough people who get them painted, pastes the
vinly posters on to the boards.
</p>

<p>
All day a guy struggles hard, to transform an ugly looking, old
hoarding into a huge attractive advertisement and he is paid so
well, that he has to slog it out to make ends meet for his family
of four. They who get the paintings made or the posters put up,
are striking it rich with loads of money and fame. Those who drive
by, are having a good time watching that beautiful looking woman
there or fantasizing themselves in that wonderful car up
there. Then why is this person here, who slogs it out, making so
many people happy, struggling to see a smile on his daughter?
</p>

<p>
When people around can get paid handsomely for having a jolly time
in the air-conditioned room, puking out a few lines of code each
day, can't this guy, sweating it out in this may heat, get a
better deal? Isn't there something fundamentally wrong
somewhere?

I'll be on board the Amaravathi Express in less than three hours
from now! Bags packed, I'm waiting for the sun to rise, the World
to wake up.
</p>

<p>
I have set my self an objective of completing 40 problems from
Project Euler. I have done 39. [With exams going on I consider it
good progress] I will be attempting to push off the last one
before leaving. Here I come, Project Euler. Here I come,
Hyderabad!

Back again with another khichdi of a post.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Quark, Waves and Apogee. [For the uninitiated, Quark is our
technical festival and Waves, our Cul-fest] I had been to
BITS-Pilani, for attending their Tech-fest, Apogee.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One would expect Apogee to end up the best, but we were
thoroughly disappointed. It came nowhere near the perfection
of Quark and things seemed quite unprofessional. Hats-off to
Chaitu n others in the Quark Org-Co. I'm already worried
about missing Quark'09 [thanks to my PS]
</li>
<li>The specials at all three events were unforgettable. Feeding
the Fish, the Air Shows (Naval and Amateur planes), the
Orchestral performance, Special Performance [Aasra], Sand
art by Gagan and Mithali!
</li>
<li>Had the opportunity, to meet/have a look at some of the guys
studying at colleges in their home towns. For once, I felt
being in a "reputed", national college does matter.
</li>
<li>Felt good spending some time with good ol' friends at
Pilani.
</li>
<li>Always believed organizing events isn't my forte, but,
helped organize a couple of events at Quark. Feels good.
</li>
<li>Effective Communication is less about how well you choose
your words but more about your quantum of concern for the
other person and the matter at hand!
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Pilani Campus, Love at First sight. Never really felt like
coming back.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The arts/non-technical clubs there are simply superb! We
have a lot to learn
</li>
<li>Cycling on campus. A dream come true!
</li>
<li>All Night Canteen is a real hangout place!
</li>
<li>Green, Greener, Greenest. Never really felt like we were in
the deserts of Rajasthan.
</li>
<li>…. the list can go on and on. I'll stop here.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>FOSS n me.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Attended my first FOSS event! The Install Fest @
Quark. Wasn't as awe inspiring as I would've liked it to be,
but still a memorable one. Simply for being my first
install-fest and for the lessons we learnt.
</li>
<li>FOSSKriti'08 is one event I'll regret missing. It was
absolutely amazing. I'm just hoping, people here too get to
that level soon enough.
</li>
<li>Free Software and Freeware ain't the same stuff. It's
extremely painful when people address FOSS stuff as
freeware. Free Software is Software that's Free as in Free
Speech n Freeware is software that if free as in free beer.
</li>
<li>Eagerly awaiting mukt.in v2. Can't wait to get back home!
</li>
<li>Enjoying my time on \#mukt.in and \#linux-india. The new DC
hub (GNOME) for FOSS junta is cool too!
</li>
<li>There's an urgent need to start contributing to FOSS. But
how?
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Haven't yet found myself an intern/project for summer. Wonder
what's in store, this summer.
</li>
<li>Most of the gang's On-Campus next sem. Will really miss Voodoo
though. Hoping he has a rocking PS.
</li>
<li>Hoping we won't have to shift hostels next sem.
</li>
<li>Appreciation is a great motivator. Expressing it promptly is
important. I'm bad at it. Should work on it.
</li>
<li>"The gang" is like a flock of birds in flight.
</li>
<li>This semester is coming to an end already, and I don't have
anything I'd be proud of.
</li>
<li>Wonder why I have absolutely no feelings about the farewell we'd
be having soon.
</li>
<li>Awaiting Ugadi Celebs. Seems like they are gonna rock more than
ever.
</li>
<li>Gone are those days, when I used to post because something I had
to write about, compelled me to do so. These days, the long
inactivity on my blog is turning out to be the sole reason for
my posts. [A few Rare Exceptions though, and this one isn't] I
wonder if its because life's become uneventful or because I grew
lazier or because of something else.
</li>
<li>I don't like posting accounts of events from the recent/distant
past, but I'm doing it just to prevent my blog's death.
</li>

In memory of two gems, Koteshwar Rao Sir and Madhusudhan.
</p>

<p>
This, surely is a tremendous loss for the world, especially the
world of Math. I pray, from the bottom of my heart, May your Souls
rest in peace.
</p>

<p>
I got to know both of them at the same place, IIT Study Circle,
Hyderabad. Its not for long that I've been there and known them,
but both of them definitely have a special place in my heart.
</p>

<p>
Koti, as we lovingly called him, will always remain an inspiration
for me. ( and hundreds of others who've had the fortune to be his
students ) An Inspiration to thoroughly love and enjoy what I am
doing… to dedicate my life to something worthwhile… to be
uncompromising on the quality of work I do. Though I've failed
miserably in learning any amount of Math from him, I feel
privileged to have been his student.
</p>

<p>
and Madhusudhan was my bench-mate in there! I didn't speak much to
him there, [speaking to your neighbors was a sin at that place]
but I'll never forget the Ratna days; Sanskrit/English classes
once in a while, Chemistry Labs, Cycle rides/Walks back from
college along with Veeru and Srinu discussing everything under the
sun and the Krotov solving session in the park. Memories are all,
that remain…
