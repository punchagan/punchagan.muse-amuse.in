After a short break, I'm back to blogging!
A few things have changed meanwhile. A lot haven't.

+ Noetic Nought shall now be called Rustic Reverie.

+ The Blogs I read page is now manually populated. More pages might be
  coming soon.

+ My web presence has almost been reduced to just this blog. I hope to
  be blogging more often this time around. I guess I'll have shorter
  and more frequent posts. "Release early, Release often."

+ I've been inspired by Sacha Chua and her wonderful blog. She puts up
  anything that -
  - she may look up in future.
  - could be remotely useful to anybody on this planet.

  I like her idea of "thinking of writing as sketching". "Keep
  repeating yourself, until the core message floats to the top". It
  feels similar to the idea - "Release early, Release often."

+ Also, Thanks to Madhu and Vattam who set an impossibly high standard
  by having their resumes and letters of recommendations and other
  "personal" stuff on version control on public repositories.

+ All my posts will be made from org2blog - a little org-mode based
  client that I hacked up. Emacs and Org-mode all the way! This is the
  first post by me (and probably anybody) from org2blog!
