  <punchagan> hi all

  <BerntH> hi punchagan   [18:36]

  <punchagan> BerntH: ever used/tried blorg or blorgit?  [18:47]

  <punchagan> I like the way org-publish works, but blorg exports one org file as a blog. If blorg were to be re-written on top of org-publish, how should it be done? use one file per post or just one file for the whole blog?  [18:52]

  <bremner> punchagan: another option is to use ikiwiki and use the org-mode plugin to render pages. This is what i do, although only a bit of the site is in org.  [19:44]

  <punchagan> bremner: can I have a look at your site?  [19:45]

  <bremner> sure, it ain't pretty, but: www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner  [19:46]

  <punchagan> thanks. I'll keep this in mind.   [19:47]

  <punchagan> I just loved the way this site looks and behaves -- http://julien.danjou.info/projects.html

  <bremner> well, the side bar at least is possible with ikiwiki. Other than that I suppose it is mainly a matter of css  [19:48]

  <BerntH> punchagan: nope  [19:49]

  <punchagan> ok BerntH  [19:50]

  <plovs> punchagan ikiwiki does have an org-mode plugin  [19:56]

  <punchagan> plovs: yes, bremner told me that and I've seen on Worg too. :)

  <plovs> punchagan ah, yes, sorry

  <punchagan> plovs: it's alright.   [19:59]

  <plovs> punchagan another possibility is org2blog, which uses wordpress

  <punchagan> plovs: I'm the author of it. :D

  <plovs> lol, ik, *that* punchagan   [20:17]

  <punchagan> lol

  <punchagan> plovs: were you kidding? or serious?  [20:19]

  <plovs> punchagan sorry to say i was serious, but it will not happen again :-)

  <plovs> i really like org2blog, played with it yesterday

  <punchagan> plovs: no. I was just wondering if you were playing around with me. :P

  <punchagan> I'm happy some one thinks it is useful.

  <plovs> lol, no, i just didn't recognized your name, although it is kind of hard to miss  [20:21]

  <punchagan> I hope you don't mind, if I make this anecdote public?
