This post is by Dominick Mills, coming to us, thanks to
Bloggerstock.  Dominick aka Lije blogs at Lije's Mindstate.  My post
on this month's Bloggerstock topic will appear at That Ain't Kosher.
</p>

<p>
And here is Dominick's post for you
</p>
<hr>

<p>
Hello world..today I'll be talking about a period in time I would like
to do-over, however I couldn't think of anything so I went in another
direction….I'd like to thank Bloggerstock and punchagan for
the opportunity leak my thoughts on this page….
</p>

<p>
I hope the readers understand that my views does not reflect those of
the host's page..before I get started though Let me take the time out
to explain what Bloggerstock is all about.  Bloggerstock is the
brainchild of a small group of bloggers who connected on 20SB. The
idea comes from the concept of a blog-swap in that maybe we could
create our own kind of event where we all wrote posts to be posted on
the next person’s blog. Essentially forming a blog-ring.
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of things in life everyone would like to relive and do
differently..I've been giving it some thought and it's been racking my
brain for the whole month now…I came to the conclusion that I have
nothing I'd like to really do-over…
</p>

<p>
My reason for this is that I wouldn't be this person I am…and I
wouldn't alter it in anyway…I love what I've become…if it weren't
for all the good and bad that occurred during my life time..I wouldn't
even be here writing this….or I wouldn't even have the same goals
and all my aspirations would be small…I know this all sounds weird
but giving the fact that I am a weird person, those who know me, this
is expected…I believe in things happening for a reason and without
these occurrences we'd be something totally different, and
</p>

<p>
maybe not becoming what we're suppose to be in life…sometimes we
look at situations and think, " Just maybe if I had done this… or
maybe if I hadn't…" even if my decisions had made into a bum on the
streets I think I would feel the same way…truth is we all have
regrets..learning to live with them is the hardest thing to do..we
tend to get caught up in the moment and want to relive those
things..either for the good or the bad…but we fail to realize that
it is those things that build character not for today but for our
tomorrows.
</p>

<p>
Whether it's falling for the wrong person, being back stabbed from a
friend, getting hoodwinked from a stranger, or missing out on an
opportunity….all of these are just life's lessons being taught..with
that being said you should never sulk over a decision we've made…in
the end we're our own cause of grief or happiness so don't whine about
it stuff that's happened….accept what has happened and move
forward…don't hold on to them, but don't forget them either…these
are turning points in our lives so appreciate them..
</p>

<p>
Well that's all I have to conjure up on the matter..though it kind of
went against the topic a bit but hey am stubborn lol.. once again I'd
like to thank punchagan for allowing me to feature on Rustic
Reverie and also Bloggerstock for providing me with the opportunity to
express myself on a fellow blogger's page.. here's a link to my page
