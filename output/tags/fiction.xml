It was a pleasant Saturday evening, in the middle of the winter.
Christmas was just round the corner and love, in the air. The sun was
just setting, and everything outside his window was given a fresh coat
of snow, tickled by the red, quickly fading light. Not that he
noticed. He stared blankly out of the window, looking at nothing in
particular. He had just woke up from his afternoon nap, but he'd buy
it, if you told him he'd been sleeping for a year…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You could see the icy river, crawling ahead, from his window.  People
walking over the bridge, a few camera flashes going off, people
stopping over and looking far ahead into the horizon, collecting their
thoughts, couples walking hand-in-hand enjoying each others'
company… You could see it all, from up there! But, as they say, you
only see what you look for. And he, couldn't see any of this. His
looked out of his window, and saw none of this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He is walking down the same bridge. He didn't know where he was going;
his head at least. His legs did; as always. He was walking down in his
regular yellow shirt and black jeans, that you could mistake for a
uniform, if you followed him for a few days. Extremely under-dressed
for the chilly night, one would say. He kept walking down the main
street, lined with shops brightly lit up for the festive season. The
pavement bustled with with people walking with a spring in their step
– the spring that the festive season, and all the love in the air
brought to you. Not that he noticed it, or had any of it in his step.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Soon, he's walking through the park. The park that was built to
celebrate time, ticking away, furiously. Or to celebrate the time
everyone in the world had, to enjoy themselves. He walked past the
skating rink, with lots of people having the time of their life ice
skating, and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The first timers, old
and young, making up for their inexperience, with their excitement;
holding onto whatever they can, to finish their next round, to start
their next. The veterans, taking the center-stage and showing off
their moves! He was barely aware of their presence and just walked on,
past all the action.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The music festival; he walked past it to, like the crowd didn't exist,
the noise didn't, the music didn't; like there was nothing happening!
The fountain "felt" no different. The cold breeze, did sprinkle the
water to quite a distance and everybody kept a safe distance to avoid
the chilling shower, except for the kids, who found it amusing to run
into the shower for a split second and run back madly. How could he
walk just by it, and not feel a thing!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lakefront. That is where his legs always brought him, at the
end. The brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don't
believe he saw any of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept
staring, as the night got chillier, and the neighborhood kept getting
more and more deserted. Seconds ticked away, minutes and hours passed
by! He stayed on, staring ahead. It didn't matter how much below zero
the mercury had gone. This wasn't the first night he was spending
staring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the coldest night,
in a decade. But that didn't matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing has,
for a while now; Ever since he turned cold.

I am unread.  Unlike you, who classify yourselves as well-read or
not, I am classified as unread or not.  Well, you could call me
not well-read too, I guess.  I was looked at once, my innards
glanced through, and was hurriedly marked as unread, starred and
tagged.  Given my length, the care with which I was composed, and
the flurry with which I was stowed away, I probably contain
something important, to be read at the opportune moment, something
to be cherished and to be replied to with diligence and care.  I
felt a sense of pride.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I got composed and sent weeks ago, and have been lying here
untouched, since.  I get buried deeper and deeper every day, with
a daily flood of newer stuff piling up onto me.  While my
composer, eagerly awaits a reply, (less and less eagerly each day,
though) I have lost all hope of being read and replied to.  I
curse myself for carrying something so important.  A thousand
other replies have been sent, and a few thousand others composed
here, but my turn hasn't come, yet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How I wish, it'd be my turn today.  How I wish, I could push my
way up through to the top of the stack.  How I wish, I could see
the eager wait come to an end!  How I wish, I'm given the
attention I deserved, today!  Reply, ASAP!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
PS: Apologies for all those emails that are still starred and
unread, in my Inbox…
