I used to have a separate page for bookmarks and quotes on the old
blog.  They will now be shared as regular posts with 5 or more
bookmarks/quotes.  I use a bookmarklet in my browser to capture links
to an org-file using org-capture protocol and then I have a small
plugin to Nikola, that looks at such captured bookmarks and quotes and
makes new posts out of them.  This workflow is inspired by Brett
Trepestra's <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/01/15/a-web-excursions-system-for-static-blogs/">web excursions</a> plugin.
</p>

<p>
The plugin is currently a part of my blog source, and not published to
Nikola's plugin repository since it is very specific to my setup.  But
if anybody is interested, I can publish the code somewhere public.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested to get these links and bookmarks into your feed
reader, you can subscribe to their feed: <a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/categories/quotes.xml">quotes</a>, <a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/categories/bookmarks.xml">bookmarks</a>.  These
posts will also make it to the main feed, though.

Sigh! I made yet another change to the way this blog gets published.
But, I have a feeling this mechanism, is here to stay!
</p>

<p>
We've been using Nikola quite regularly for our <a href="http://ultimatesport.in">Ultimate site</a>, and I
quite like it.  I've also contributed a bunch of features to Nikola to
get it to work the way I would like it to.  This weekend I ported my
blog from <a href="https://github.com/renard/o-blog">o-blog</a> to <a href="http://getnikola.com">Nikola</a>.  The only thing that was stopping me
from doing it, until now is the fact that all my posts are in
org markup and porting them over to one of the formats that Nikola
supports would be a PITA.  So, I wrote a <a href="http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode">pretty simple plugin</a> to
Nikola to support posting from org files.  And then with a <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/6970578">little
Python</a>, I was able to move everything over to use Nikola.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, I'll keep my blog more updated, from here on!

        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
Well, I'm not sure if it's worth writing about.  I conducted my
first org-mode workshop along with Prof. Venkatesh Choppella at
IIIT-Hyderabad.  It was a 3 hour demo+talk kind of a thing, with a
small audience of about 20 people, most of whom were new to
Emacs.
</p>

<p>
We covered almost all the aspects of Org-mode after giving a brief
introduction to Emacs.  Outlining and note-taking part was simple
and easy to understand, but the audience couldn't really
appreciate the part of keeping TODO lists and agendas and other
stuff.  I'm hoping, the reason was not me taking over from
Venkatesh.
</p>

<p>
I think the workshop should've been more hands-on and we should've
asked people to try out stuff on the spot, instead of showing off
the things possible with Emacs.  They probably would've
appreciated a few things better, that way.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, we will be doing more workshops on Org-mode and there
are surely somethings to take away from this one.  I hope at least
one of the participants, gets hooked to Org-mode.
</p>

<p>
The talk outline is here.

I accidentally came across the blog-post Git-powered wikis
improved - GitHub. And this particular paragraph caught my
eye:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The new editor has the capability to support every markup
language that GitHub Wikis support. If you're a fan of Markdown,
Textile, pod or RDoc, the function bar buttons (e.g. bold,
italic, underline, etc.) will now work. We've even written brand
new inline help for many of GitHub Wiki's supported markup
languages.
</p>

<p>
The language definitions the editor uses are JSON-based and easy
to edit. If you'd like us to support a markup language that we
don't currently support, Gollum, GitHub's wiki software, is
entirely open source – fork our code and send us a pull request
with changes that support your choice language.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I sent a quick patch for org-mode in the function bar, and it has
been accepted.  :)
</p>

<p>
If not anything more, I hope, at least a couple of curious people
will explore org-mode and find it useful.

Well, as you can see, I've changed my blog a bit.  I had been
trying to make it gel well with org-mode and looking for ways to
allow me to share arbit stuff with separate feeds for tags,
separate pages with independent feeds, etc.
</p>

<p>
I finally got around to tweaking the code of reprise to be able to
do this.  There are still a few things I would like to change, but
I'll make the changes gradually.  The looks are also straight from
uddigal's reprise, with a few tiny tweaks.  I hope it is alright
to be using it.  I really liked the theme.
</p>

<p>
Every tag now has a separate feed. <code>/tags/emacs.atom</code> will give
you the feed of <code>emacs</code> for instance. Also, I plan to have a
couple of more pages, one for all the interesting links I come
across and another for interesting quotes.  Both of these pages,
have their own feeds too (<code>quotes.atom</code> and <code>links.atom</code>).
</p>

<p>
In the spirit of minimalism, I got rid of comments.  I've been
looking for ways of having comments without all the javascript
cruft from disqus, but I didn't find any satisfactory way to do
this.  So, the site will have no comments.  You can write to me,
in case you've something to say to me.

Org-mode, as a mode, is obviously awesome.  The ability to move
around whole blocks of text, for re-organizing documents and the
usability of tables are just two brilliant features.
</p>

<p>
But, the org markup itself is such a cool thing.  I've been
looking at <code>rst</code> all day, and it's such a pain to find out where
your headings are, what level your current sub-heading is at, etc.
(I'll probably do a bit better, with some getting used to. I'm an
org-addict. ;)).  With org-mode it's so intuitive!  It's so easy
to find out, with just one quick look!  I don't think any other
markup has this coolness! Org-mode FTW!

        <div class="post"> <p>
Pandoc is a haskell library and a command line tool, that can
convert markup from one to another and it does it pretty well.
Until now it supported quite a few markups, but not orgmode.  But
now, Orgmode support has been added! Yay!
</p>

<p>
But, it can only read from other formats and write to org-mode
format.  The other way around, is not possible, but you can do
that straight from org-mode, right?
</p>

<p>
I've often felt the need for an org-importer and hence decided to
do something about it.  I stumbled upon Pandoc, when I was moving
my blog, and found it pretty neat.  After, yet another request for
an importer, on the org-mode mailing list, I decided to look at
Pandoc.  I was somehow under the impression that it was written in
Python.  But it turned out, I had to learn Haskell!  A good excuse
to learn a new language, eh?  I brushed through a tutorial for a
couple of days (and was blown off by the paradigm of the language)
and was able to port the RST writer in Pandoc, to an Org
writer.  :)

It's just a matter of one <code>git commit</code> and <code>push</code>.  I need to
fine-tune the shell script a bit, though.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
I looked at a handful of options to maintain a blog, using
org-mode — <code>blorg</code>, <code>org-jekyll</code>, <code>blorgit</code>, <code>ikiwiki</code>.
After some assessment, I decided upon <code>org-jekyll</code> and
<code>jekyll</code>.  But then, I accidentally stumbled upon <code>hyde</code>.
</p>

<p>
I decided to go with <code>hyde</code> instead of <code>jekyll</code> <sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="/posts/wp-to-org-mode-hyde-disqus.html#fn.6">6</a></sup>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It's in Python.  I didn't want to start figuring out Ruby,
now.

<li>It uses Django templates <sup><a id="fnr.7" name="fnr.7" class="footref" href="/posts/wp-to-org-mode-hyde-disqus.html#fn.7">7</a></sup>.  And Django is
something, I wish to learn.  I've started with that. :)

I then "ported" <code>org-jekyll.el</code> into <code>org-hyde.el</code>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>removed stuff like categories and languages, that I was not
going to use.

<li>Added some code w.r.t timestamps, from org2blog, to it, so
that my older <code>org2blog</code> posts could be easily ported.

This was the most painful posts.  Importing all the old posts
from Wordpress.  <code>org-mode</code> really needs a XHTML/XML importer!
</p>

<p>
I did all sorts of crazy stuff to get this done.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>used pandoc to convert html to <code>markdown</code>
</li>
<li>wrote some throw away regex code to convert <code>markdown</code> to
      <code>org-mode</code>.
</li>

Set up <code>git</code> along with some <code>bash</code> code, to have a mechanism
to minimize the effort in making a blog post.  All this is
still a lot of work, compared to the ease with which I used to
use <code>org2blog</code>.  That's partly due to <code>ssh</code> restrictions in my

&lt;punchagan&gt; hi all
</p>

<p>
&lt;BerntH&gt; hi punchagan   [18:36]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; BerntH: ever used/tried blorg or blorgit?  [18:47]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I like the way org-publish works, but blorg exports one org file as a blog. If blorg were to be re-written on top of org-publish, how should it be done? use one file per post or just one file for the whole blog?  [18:52]
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; punchagan: another option is to use ikiwiki and use the org-mode plugin to render pages. This is what i do, although only a bit of the site is in org.  [19:44]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; bremner: can I have a look at your site?  [19:45]
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; sure, it ain't pretty, but: www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner  [19:46]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; thanks. I'll keep this in mind.   [19:47]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I just loved the way this site looks and behaves – <a href="http://julien.danjou.info/projects.html">http://julien.danjou.info/projects.html</a>
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; well, the side bar at least is possible with ikiwiki. Other than that I suppose it is mainly a matter of css  [19:48]
</p>

<p>
&lt;BerntH&gt; punchagan: nope  [19:49]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; ok BerntH  [19:50]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan ikiwiki does have an org-mode plugin  [19:56]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: yes, bremner told me that and I've seen on Worg too. :)
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan ah, yes, sorry
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: it's alright.   [19:59]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan another possibility is org2blog, which uses wordpress
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: I'm the author of it. :D
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; lol, ik, <b>that</b> punchagan   [20:17]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; lol
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: were you kidding? or serious?  [20:19]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan sorry to say i was serious, but it will not happen again :-)
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; i really like org2blog, played with it yesterday
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: no. I was just wondering if you were playing around with me. :P
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I'm happy some one thinks it is useful.
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; lol, no, i just didn't recognized your name, although it is kind of hard to miss  [20:21]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I hope you don't mind, if I make this anecdote public?

I'm now officially a part of the Arch Linux community! Arch Linux
is a lightweight and flexible Linux® distribution that tries to
Keep It Simple.
</p>

<p>
I have started using arch from less than a week or so. It took me
a while, not too long, to realize the beauty of this distro. I was
trying to tweak the settings of my org-mode's remember (on
Karmic), trying to make it work the way I liked it. After breaking
my head with .emacs and lisp for a while, I realized the version
of my org-mode was way different from the version of the docs, I
was reading. It didn't take long to figure out, which version of
org-mode to get. As a matter of curiosity, I checked AUR for the
version, and true to Arch's reputation it was bleeding edge! I was
still using Karmic, since I hadn't got my Arch installation
working the way I like it, yet. Out of laziness. sudo reboot; to
hell with laziness!
</p>

<p>
I was setting up things I regularly use, tweaking my way
around. After a day or so, I find python-numpy is out of date. And
to top it, an orphaned package! I didn't feel one bit good about
this. After some futile attempts to suppress my discomfort, I sat
down to work.
</p>

<p>
After an afternoon of effort, I created my first PKGBUILD. :) I
now have python-numpy installed using pacman! Pleasure to join the
Arch User Community! Also, thanks to lifeeth and Lynus Vaz, for
the sparks.
</p>

<p>
PS: I'm using Arch with Openbox. It's neat! PPS: org-mode is
really awesome! It's a world in itself. life in plain text,
truly!]
