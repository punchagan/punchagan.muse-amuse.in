Dear owner-of-a-random-web-startup,
</p>

<p>
Thank you for starting your brand new, awesome web service.  But,
please don't expect me to use it, if you ask me to have a password
with atleast one upper-case letter, one numeral, one symbol and
one unicode hindi character and 20 hebrew characters.  Is it
really so essential to enforce such complicated rules on my
passwords, making it difficult for me to remember what password I
used?  Isn't OAuth and OpenID so much easier to use?  If you
really want to enforce such complex rules on my password, at least
show the arbitrary rules you enforce on me, at the login prompt too!
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,
A frustrated-web-monkey

        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
Like most bloggers, I keep looking at my blogs hits once in a
while. (Sometimes inspires to write better; and more often.) The
post that gets most hits these days is my post on mailman,
postfix, et al. But the search term that's increasingly bringing
people to my blog is "punchagan".
</p>

<p>
This scares me. What makes people search for me? What makes people
search more often these days? Why am I scared?
</p>

<p>
Why do people use monikers or online identities? I started off
with the idea of anonymity and privacy; keeping my online identify
separate from my real one. But it, obviously, is a folly to have
you email id with the same handle. Now, almost anybody who knows
me, also knows my online handle. They can find me anywhere and
everywhere with just a few keystrokes (and Google). Also, the
uniqueness of my handle doesn't help one bit. Any search returns
over 90% relevant results.
</p>

<p>
Is it time to get lost in the crowd with a new handle? ;) Probably
not. I don't have much to hide under the covers. Let the world see
– who I am, who I have been; where I am, where I have been.
</p>

<p>
Peace.

<p>
<b>Notice for the Internet Usage</b>
</p>

<p>
Internet Facility is provided to students for academic activities
and e-mails. It is observed that few students are misusing the
Internet facility by using excessive internet bandwidth for
non-academic purposes. The students who are running the hubs are
strictly informed to close their hubs. Computer Center will be
starting official hub for the sharing of academic information and
open source softwares.
</p>

<p>
If a student is found while doing so the network facility will be
blocked by Computer Center for a semester. Further, a student will
be called by a disciplinary committee and a severe disciplinary
action will be taken.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This Notice from the Computer Center is creating waves all
around. This isn't the first time, though, that the people
in-charge of the Network have "acted".
</p>

<p>
Academic activities; wonder what it's definition is, in their
dictionaries. It surely includes the following.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using Internet for 'academic activities' or emails, during
class-room hours makes no sense.
</li>
<li>Anything 'academic' cannot have a size greater than 5 MB.
</li>
<li>Accessing version control systems ( svn, cvs et al ) cannot be
classified 'academic'
</li>
<li>IRC cannot teach you anything. Don't ever dream of thinking it
as 'academic' to hang out on \#python or \#emacs
</li>
<li>All 'academic' stuff is limited to the http(s) ports. You
wouldn't need to use any other ports, ever.
</li>
<li>Any 'academic' activity fits within a span of 2 hours or can be
done in blocks of 2 hours each, with gaps of 2 hours in between.
</li>
<li>'Academic' stuff doesn't definitely contain key-words chosen by
the "all-knowing" admins.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Moreover, the people in-charge who refused to allow the use of a
computer in the CC as a server for on-campus repositories of
GNU/Linux packages, now wish to host a 'hub' for sharing
open-source softwares! There's already an official ftp server
which hosts the academic info and a few useful softwares. I don't
see how a hub would be different.
</p>

<p>
We don't have any disciplinary committees for people smoking in
hostel rooms, causing a lot of trouble for others around them, but
we are going to have them for hosting hubs. ( Well, a new law
banning smoking in public places in India has been passed just a
few days ago. Hopefully it'll work better than the older one,
since now there's some pressure on the people in-charge of the
public place. )
</p>

<p>
Also, it could be argued that college isn't meant only for
'academic' learning and a lots of other learning takes place here
(and the hubs were definitely helping quite a bit) but I'll leave
that for another day, probably. Also, I don't think 18+ year olds,
people who are about to step into various big roles, leading the
country need to be told how to make use of the
facilities/resources available to them; A degree of freedom is
indispensable, I believe.
</p>

<p>
I appreciate the efforts being made to improve the network
situation here and also help the students get the most (
'academically' ) out of their college experience, but I feel the
situation deserves more careful handling.
