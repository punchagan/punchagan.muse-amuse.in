I like the idea of pair blogging. Cate and Sacha, seem to be doing
it (intentionally or not). One person blogs on a topic he/she's
presently thinking about and the other person posts his/her views
on the same issue.  Well, comments are meant for that, but a blog
post seems to give you greater freedom.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
PS: I called it pair-blogging. I don't know if it already has a
name or if pair-blogging means something else.

No.  Not the Obama change.  I'm talking of change as in small
denominations of cash.  Everybody is reluctant to part with
it.  There's always a problem with getting it.  I'm often worried
before getting into a bus or an auto, or going to a shop whether
or not the guy would give me change for a 50, 100 or a 500.
People so reluctant to "part" with it. What are they saving it
for?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think the situation would be much better if people readily gave
it, when required.  There would be a free flow and if not anything
more, I wouldn't have to worry about it when going somewhere.
But, I "feel" this would actually reduce the instances when both
the parties don't have enough change with them. What do you think?

I've often got bad service from "service providers" - hotels,
restaurants, phone services, Internet services etc. I guess that's
due to the population in India. If one customer goes back unhappy
that doesn't really make a difference, because there would be
hundred others already waiting in the queue.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You, as a, service provider would get your share of customers and
profits, no matter how bad you are. Thanks to the population.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One solution could be, to write about the bad service you got from
a provider and make people aware of it, but often there aren't
enough options, for others to choose from. Inevitably, the bad
service provider is going to get some customers. What's the way
out?
