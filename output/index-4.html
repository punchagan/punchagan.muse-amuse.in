<b>Disambiguation:</b> The original Linux on 2 Floppies is here.
</p>

<p>
I, post this from a remastered version of Knoppix that we named
Floppix!
</p>

<p>
It all actually began, with me deciding to do a bit of Emacs-ing
at home during the winter hols but I don't have a Linux box at
home. Live-CD is the way to go! But then Emacs doesn't \*usually\*
go with Live-CDs. So I decided to get around making my own. :)
[Dunnet "Dunnet Game"),
an Adventure game in Emacs, played a crucial role in motivating me
to go ahead!] The rest as they say is history….
</p>

<p>
Actually, I tried a debootstrap from my Debian etch but I couldn't
manage to get the initrd working. [[<a href="http://avudem.blogspot.com">http://avudem.blogspot.com</a>
"Voodoo"][I ain't this geekish, its only that I am incapable of
putting these terms in a simpler language.] After numerous futile
attempt, I gave up for the time being and that's when the genius
of [Voodoo]] came in, he took a different route. Remastering
Knoppix.[Modifying an existing Live-CD of Knoppix]
</p>

<p>
I won't get into the exact details of how we got about it. There's
a lot of online help available for that.
</p>

<p>
A few highlights, for the curious reader…
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>got rid of the default KDE and replaced it with
Fluxbox. [actually Floppix = Fluxbox + Knoppix :P]
</li>
<li>added emacs, cmucl, slime, octave, linuxdcpp, vlc and others.
</li>
<li>got rid of other packages which we weren't going to use.
</li>
<li>changed the boot message
</li>
<li>changed the default background image.
</li>
<li>removed the default boot image [ couldn't change it as the image
we chose wasn't being properly converted to lss16 format ]
</li>
<li>tested the CD with Qemu [size of the iso got more than 700MB]
</li>
<li>removed a few other not so regularly used packages [including
wine!]
</li>
<li>burnt the CD
</li>
<li>Logged in!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, that I've logged in, I realize we managed to quite a decent
job. Obviously we weren't perfect. It was the first time and done
in quite a hurry. [btw, we have our end-sems going on; I've no
exam tomorrow though] I was able to listen to music, connect to
the DC, play a game of dunnet and make a blogpost! We also missed
a few packages, for instance a screen shot capture program! But it
ain't too bad, still a long way to go though!
</p>

<p>
Just hoping we manage to make it better, as we get better at it!
;)
</p>

<p>
Here comes FloppixV0.1!
</p>


<hr>

<p>
Update [3/1/08]: I never knew that GIMP could capture screenshots!
ImageMagick can do that too. I had two programs at hand and
thought I had none! Here's a Screenshot of the Floppix Desktop.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Update 2 [4/1/08]: There is already a floppy distro of Linux
called Floppix. I knew about this only when some one searching for
it reached my blog. Guess I should do something about this. [I'll
be able to do it only after getting back to campus,though]

<li>These are just a few random musings, for those curious about my
life and for the good health of my Blog which is so close to its
death..
</li>
<li>College (+ Hostel) is amongst few places, that everyone on
Earth(&amp; elsewhere) \*must\* get the chance to be in. There's a
whole new world out here, with hell a lotuva things you can do,
Here and Only Here… [I am not, by any means, talking of
acads!]
</li>
<li>Projects. Yes they are a part of almost all my random
stuff… cos I just Love them, when they are self-assigned and
off-hand. They get even more exciting, when the learning curve
is Steep!
</li>
<li>Deadlines can be wonderful things, if only I learn to respect
them.
</li>
<li>Lab-Tests, i guess, are amongst the most hyped tests in the
World! They aren't worth all that fuss.
</li>
<li>Grades ain't everything in Life. Not even if you are doing
Engineering!
</li>
<li>I live amidst /wonderful* singers, <b>marvelous</b> music composers,
<b>facile</b> lyric writers, <b>cool</b> Hackers, <b>amazing</b> photographers,
<b>inspiring</b> poets and what not. [Why the hell do people then,
look just for the *"industrious"/ grade scorers?]
</li>
<li>Music and Sleep are Great Healers. Laughter, too, is a close
competitor.
</li>
<li>GNU/Linux is addictive. More n more people getting addicted,
everyday!
</li>
<li>RHCE's got a pretty interesting test. Its rare to be interested
in undergoing the torture of a test, ain't it?
</li>
<li>Rules seem to be total crap, until you get the chance to look at
them from above.
</li>
<li>Quark'08 coming up! Gottu gear up for it!
</li>
<li>Comprees?? They don't bother me so much any more.
</li>
<li>Finally, for those who found all the above stuff boring and
dumb… here's some food for thought &gt; The Best things in Life
aren't Things…

As I start this post, the rear-part of my body aches, after a nice
thrashing from the hostel junta. Apparently this is my gift on
having incremented my account of revolutions, around a big ball of
gases. (The total now moves on to 20) [isn't this apparent credit,
really a debit?] It was more than compensated for, with a lovely
cake though.
</p>

<p>
I just want to thank all the junta, [relatives and friends and
enemies and everyone else], who love me for what I am, even if all
they get back is stupidity, imperfection, insincerity, hypocrisy
and all sorts of crap. Thanks to everyone who pray for me to grow,
up and not just old. Thanks a Million.
</p>

<p>
A couple of decades through, and still no idea where life's taking
me. Isn't LIFE an opportunity that we need to make the most out
of?
</p>

<p>
Just hoping, this year gives me some wisdom, a little courage and
a lot more love to make the most of this opportunity.

<b>Caution</b>: This post is just some arbit crap, that arose from some
 internal probing. Its utterly worthless for any reader other than
 myself. This could possibly even be classified narcissistic or
 whatever that's called.
</p>

<p>
Presently, I've got tests going on and they are half way
through. Considering this and the fact that its been over a month
since I last posted, writing a post now doesn't make much sense,
does it?[If my blog's been dormant so long, can't it be so for a
couple of days more?] But things I've been up to off-late, don't
make much sense. [in the past, at least they made sense to me if
not to others.] This post is just about that, going from being
senseless to at least being less sense [and hopefully, to being
sensible]
</p>

<p>
I've screwed up the tests so far, and don't think will be doing
much better in the others too. Even otherwise, I haven't done
anything good, anything that feels great, anything that feels
right, in the past couple of months (years?? decades??) [except
for one video with 'the gang', i didn't contribute much
though]. Let alone accomplishing something nice, I haven't even
been attempting anything decent enough. My priorities have gone
haywire, or may be not, may be I'm just doing things that are very
low on the scale or may be I'm not doing anything, things are just
hapenning.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I've slept through 'n' classes both inside and outside the
classroom
</li>
<li>I've stayed awake all night downloading some crap for my comp.
</li>
<li>I had been worrying about keeping my blog alive. Made numerous
attempts to post something, even if its no big deal not posting
regularly.
</li>
<li>Changed 4 different OSes in a couple of days!
</li>
<li>been ages since I last visited the Library.
</li>
<li>Slept through the morning lotsa times, even if I enjoy EBER-ing
</li>
<li>Bunked bathing just because i'll have more clothes to wash!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The list is pretty long. It ain't sensible to be putting down the
whole thing here.&lt;/ul&gt; I guess I've just been trying to escape
things. Running from doing important stuff. I've had enough. Its
high time I do something about it. I've decided to get in control
of my life, rather than being controlled by arbit stuff like
sleep, a blog, a grade, an addiction, a song, a cricket match, a
rain, a meal, a game of carrom, a prof's accent, a course, a test
or other such trivialities.
</p>

<p>
I wish to get back on track!!
</p>

<p>
..to get back into the habit of doing things I love, at the time
and place I like.
</p>

<p>
..to doing things that give me joy, in the true sense. Not
momentary, passing pleasures.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, with some effort, I will. (A nudge is all it takes.)
</p>

<p>
btw, if this post was a total bouncer, this is for you….

Wish You All a Happy Independence Day..

స్వాతంత్ర  దినోత్సవ  శుభాకాంక్షలు…

[yes, I know just three of the eighteen… and no foreign ones.. ]
</p>

<p>
Every year, during this time of the year, the papers and news and
blogs and all other such media, are filled with analyses,
comments, opinions and all sorts of things on the progress made
(and not made) by Independent India…. the flavour of patriotism
that was only subtle all this while, tends to grow upon us as the
Day arrives and I'm no exception.
</p>

<p>
Being an average Indian, just one amongst the Billion, the
progress (or non-) is a very big issue for me to comment on and I
would leave that job for the better qualified or the more
courageous ones. But I wonder, I (just) wonder…..
</p>

<p>
Come August and its the beginning of a new semester, bringing
along "Elections" in campus. This time is no different… I can
see people gearing up…. campaigning has begun even before the
announcement of elections or nominations… and what goes on here?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Dude.. I don't need to campaign.. there's enough guys from our state in our hostel.. so contesting= winning.. don't worry!"
</li>
<li>"Look dude.. both of us are from the same state.. so I know you will be obviously voting for me.. but still if you want, you can have a look at my Agenda… "
</li>
<li>"Hey, its not important for me to tell you my agenda… its sufficient for you to know that my opponent hails from the other half of the country (North-South)where we hail from..
</li>
<li>"People.. we need to make sure that only one person, belonging to our state contests for this post… or the votes will get divided"
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Where are those ideals of unity and brotherhood? Isn't it
important that the best person be chosen? Shouldn't the abilities
of a candidate be considered rather than where (s)he hails from or
what tongue (s)he speaks? Isn't it an irony, that all this happens
precisely during this time, when the whole nation is celebrating
the birth of an Independent India?? Shouldn't at least the
celebrations be able to evoke the emotions of brotherhood, love
and equality amongst us?? Shouldn't the fact that all of us are
here with a purpose, a common goal of education, enough to get
over the differences of language and origin? Shouldn't the
interests of the College and the Students overpower such minor
issues??

These days my strolls, in the blog-o-sphere, have grown manifold
both in their numbers and lengths. And with every passing
step… self doubts mount up. I begin to wonder if my blogs even
worth its w8 in 'seconds'. Like the thousands of others in this
world, I could post something in one of these genres but..
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Techno Blog. [On various latest hardware, softwares, gadgets et
al..] But I ain't a geek to be able to post such stuff. If I
ever posted something of this genre.. it would just be a
copy-paste job.. isn't of any great value, given the readership
of my blog.
</li>
<li>Scientific Blog. [With the latest advances in various
disciplines of Science] Again a case similar to the previous
one. Not of much use
</li>
<li>Literary Blog.[Stories n Poems n other Creations.] I ain't a
creative being and rarely indulge in such creative acts. Would
be foolish
</li>
<li>PhotoBlog.[Creative Pics/Paintings, Worthy of Display] I own no
camera and don't borrow one too often. Also haven't got a very
Creative eye to capture magic from the ordinary. Un-healthy
</li>
<li>Daily Diary. [An account of my day-to-day tidings] My life ain't
overflowing with adventures. I am presently leading a
non-adventurous, pretty monotonous life that would be
uninteresting to readers of all classes. Ruled out for the lack
of utility.
</li>
<li>Current-affairs Blog. [An account of today's, this week's
happenings] Not interested in being a Journalist, there's
already lotsa people who can handle the job better.
</li>
<li>Humour Blog. [Laugh and Let Laugh!] Again there's a lot of it
already online, and with a sense of humour like mine, the
difference made would be Nought.
</li>
<li>Inspirational Blog. [Inspire others to do their best.] Its
pointless preaching what I don't practice. That would be
hypocrisy.
</li>
<li>Information Blog. [Any info possibly..from pet-care to ethnic
goan recipes…] I haven't yet crammed in so much into the
super-computer on my top-floor to beat Google.
</li>
<li>A Mixed Bag. [Posts of multiple genres] Impossible. The bag's
already empty for every item of it has already been ruled out.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Do I still need a BLOG?
</p>

<p>
ps: Prevention of boredom-induced-insanity is the one and only
genuine reason(known to me) for the continued existence of my
blog.

Note: This post isn't of much use to others (may be the same with
other posts too.. :P) Just a few ramblings of the 2 month stay @
Delhi…. (allegedly doing a Project!)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All Scientists ain't <i>Scientists</i>
</li>
<li>There's nothing <b>BIG</b> about Research papers… [You can do
all sorts of things in there… something like the TOI
comparison of Sachin and the Sensex… ;)]
</li>
<li>The "Hacker Culture" ought to be adopted (or atleast something
closer to it..) at <b>Research</b> organisations.. [I thoroughly
hated the hypocritical behaviour of the people at my PS.. ]
</li>
<li>Of all the people, the guy I found closest to being a
<b>hacker</b> [w.r.t technical skills] was the guy operating the
Photocopier… [this could well be a case of poor observation or
under-estimation, but that's what I feel right now.. ]
</li>
<li>Perfectionists manage to be <i>imperfect at the perfect</i>
time…
</li>
<li>Need to develop the ability to <b>talk</b> crap!(not just type
in.. ) [comes in quite handy.. ]
</li>
<li>I loved EBERing all these days.. got to keep it
going. [jaanees.. need some help in this.. ;) ]
</li>
<li>Loooong walks are great fun… [anybody game??]
</li>
<li>I ain't a very Creative being…
</li>
<li>I ought to learn to be more tolearant to using Windows, I
guess.. [It was a real pain using it…]
</li>
<li>My Will power (for doing stuff that I hate.. ) has tremendously
increased!! Thanks to the one and only….
</li>
<li>Any project that's not <b>my</b> choice will inevitably turn out to
be a <i>Projest</i> [can't say much abt the others.. ;)]
</li>
<li>Hostel in Coll is ulti cool.. don't ever dare compare any other
one with it..
</li>
<li>and found this cool pic… [I guess I need to follow him.. ;)]

I had problems with this and tried quite a few things to get it
working…  [uninstalling and re-installing
packages… downloading fonts.. etc.. ] but couldn't until I found
help here…

Yes, that's what my PS's been like.. It hasn't turned out to be as
great a learning experience as one would imagine it to be..  [or
atleast I hoped, it would be…] On the contrary, its turning out
to be bad…

Nowadays, there's a certain danger of the same thing
happening, even in the famous field of physics. I was shocked to
hear of an experiment being done at the big accelerator at the
National Accelerator Laboratory, where a person used deuterium. In
order to compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen
with light hydrogen, he had to use data from someone else's
experiment on light hydrogen, which was done on a different
apparatus. When asked why, he said it was because he couldn't get
time on the program (because there's so little time and it's such
expensive apparatus) to do the experiment with light hydrogen on
this apparatus because there wouldn't be any new result. And so
the men in charge of programs at NAL are so anxious for new
results, in order to get more money to keep the thing going for
public relations purposes, they are destroying – possibly – the
value of the experiments themselves, which is the whole purpose of
the thing. It is often hard for the experimenters there to
complete their work as their scientific integrity
demands.

When I first read this {from Feynman's Cargo Cult Science [Adapted
from a Caltech commencement address in 1974]}, I couldn't quite
figure out what or how exactly things are happening and what
exactly Feynman meant by "losing the value of experiments". But,
now I know.. thanks to my PS. A lot of stuff that goes on
here..[at least from what I can see..] is quite similar to (in
fact worse than) this. PS's been absolutely disappointing.. I
don't think I've learnt anything here that's worth the effort of
spending my hols (too), away from home…  [except for Awe-TEM] I
don't think I will be taking back anything with me..  other than
may be, a knowledge of stuff that I shouldn't learn, stuff that I
should keep away for the rest of my life…
</p>

<p>
Feynman is saying this to <b>me</b>, Right now!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
… I have just one wish for you – the good luck to be somewhere
where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have
described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain
your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on,
to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.
