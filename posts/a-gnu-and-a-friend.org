I now have a GNU! I bought it (a GNU soft toy) in memory of my friend
swathanthran from #emacs-in.  RIP swathanthran

As a bonus, I got the chance to have a photograph with just RMS and
me. Also, hoping the monetary contribution will be of some use to
FSF-India.

The thrill of getting the GNU (and the GNU itself) and shaking hands,
getting photographed with RMS is dedicated to all the lafoots and
specially to Voodoo, who taught me the meaning of the word "hacker".

Happy Hacking!

ps: I just hope and pray nobody else does anything as stupid and
shocking as what swathanthran did.
