There's a post already with 'exactly' this name.... by 9... here...
But this post doesn't have much to do with his post... [or may be it does??]

Here's a Quote on Mahatma Gandhi...
/Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a
one, as this, ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. --
Albert Einstein/

I was just wondering.... what would happen if the name Albert
Einstein was replaced by punchagan... and it turned out
that.. there's a huge huge list of candidates for replacing
Mahatma Gandhi... [This is with due respect to the Mahatma and
Einstein.. I don't, in any sense, intend to say that the Mahatma
was not a Mahatma...]

All I want to say is... I am seeing a whole lot of new things, in
people around me, that inspire awe and respect in me... that every
person is unique... every person is special.. every person can
teach you something.... there's something to learn from
everyperson... that makes me believe God,truly, created man in his
own image...

I am grateful to all the people around me (and those not around
any more..)... who have shown, are showing, and will be showing me
things bright and beautiful... wise and wonderful... which
otherwise I would have failed to see..

I am grateful... for getting me back on track.. when i go
directionless,.. for setting me examples to emulate,... for being
with me whenever i needed and will need you...

[ I would've loved to write down each and every name here.... but
that's too big a job for this little being to achieve... ]


As William Arthur Ward says....

Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it.

To All Jaani's of the World... Thanks a Lot... (I know that's too
small a word... but that's all I can give right now...)

/"God created man in His own image.... ﻿ God saw everything that He
had made, and indeed it was very good."/ Gen 1:27, 31

“A friend is one with whom you are comfortable, to whom you are
loyal, through whom you are blessed, and for whom you are
grateful.”  -- William Arthur Ward

In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We
should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner
spirit.  -- Albert Schweitzer

Sometimes it not the wealth you have but what's inside you that
others need.  -- Anonymous
