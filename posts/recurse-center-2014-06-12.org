- Came to know about the project that Tom is working on for being able
  to auth integration of GitHub and Hacker School.  This will be useful
  for me, when I get to working on the GitHub dashboard.
- I spent an hour or so to clean up by blog workflow and help scripts
  to insert tags in Nikola posts, etc.  I also have a [[https://github.com/punchagan/home-bin/blob/master/hs-post][script]] to make a
  post for each day, automatically.
- lolcommit is an interesting project, and Max is using it for logging
  his work at Hacker School.
- Learned about laziness and the consequences of it. You cannot have
  side-effects, in a lazy language, if you want to keep the sanity of
  the developers using your language.
- Pattern matching forces evaluation.
- Also, briefly read about ~seq~, halting problem and ~bottom~ from
  the Haskell wiki.
- The week ended with presentations by Hacker Schoolers from this
  batch.  It was also Alum day, so we had some Alumni visiting.  I
  missed half of the presentations because I had to leave early for
  Suguna's graduation.

I hope to continue to do some work on the tutorials during the
weekend, and get back to it and finish them next week.
