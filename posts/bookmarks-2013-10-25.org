  I, for one, should be able to dance shamelessly and if possible,
  infect others as well

  it is not every day that you get to play against someone with 13000
  Test runs. It is not every day that you get to play against someone
  you have adored and idolised since the first time you saw him. It is
  not every day that you play against Rahul Dravid!

  If you have legacy code in MATLAB, then it may make sense to just
  continue using it. If it works, don’t fix it. However, if your
  Matlab code keeps causing you pain, Python might be a solution.

  We're one month into the second year of Catalyst, an after-school
  tech/computer class that I run for kids aged 9-13, and this year
  I've decided to try something different. [Last year, I had the kids
  learn in a browser-based / console-like IDE that I created - kind of
  like CodeAcademy, but ultimately it was just too much work to
  maintain and too limiting]. My new plan is to teach the kids how to
  build their own interactive websites from scratch using HTML, CSS
  and Javascript, and to do it on their own Linux VPS (CentOS 6) using
  Vim. I know it probably sounds crazy, but if the preliminary
  reception and results are any indication, I think it's going to be a
  success.

  Here is a fun bucket list of the places you simply have to visit
  before you turn thirty. They are not just destinations but also
  crazy experiences that will go down the book of your memory
  lane. From treading on Living Root Bridges in Cherrapunji to a bike
  ride through Ladakh, trekking through the valley of flowers in
  Himalayas to surfing in Orissa, here are some insane experiences.
