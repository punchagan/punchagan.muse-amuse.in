I have been reading a bunch of articles on the SuperMemo site (including the
[[http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol.htm][original thesis]] of P. A. Wozniack, the creator of SuperMemo).  I initially
started off trying to understand the algorithms SM2,5 and 8 which org-drill
implements, but reading the articles has given me a lot of general background
and theory on how memory works, and why SuperMemo is as effective as it is (for
those who stick with it).  This blog post is an attempt to summarize and
capture what I have read in all those [[http://www.supermemo.com/english/contents.htm][articles]], and not get lost in them.  I
would recommend reading the thesis and the suggested reading there, yourself,
but if you really don't want to -- this blog post + the summary in [[http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm#Prioritize][here]], and
[[http://www.supermemo.com/articles/decalog.htm#decalog][here]] would be a good alternative.

- Memory works by repetition.  Each time you recall a fact, the time it takes
  for the memory to fade increases.  Spaced repetition is the idea of repeating
  items, just when you are about to forget them -- trying to optimize the time
  spent on learning, as well as the retention of learned material.

- Prioritization of the items we need to learn is key to being able to stick to
  Spaced repetition.  Beginners tend to be over-enthusiastic about the
  technique and fill up their system with stuff that they don't really care
  about.  Applicability of the knowledge you are trying to gain, is a good test
  for whether or not it goes into your system.

- Each version of SuperMemo comes with a slightly modified (on most occassions,
  improved!) algorithm.  SM2, SM5, ... refer to these algorithms. Org-drill
  currently supports only sm2,5 and 8.  It may be worth looking at sm15/16 and
  seeing if it can be implemented and is worth doing.  In any case, using any
  of these is *way* better than not using Spaced repetition at all.

- Understanding what we are trying to learn goes a long way in helping
  memory. It is, therefore, good to start with basic material. People have been
  surprised by how easily the advanced stuff fell into place, once they had the
  basics covered.

- Keep items in the system simple.  Stick to the minimum information
  principle.  Keeping it simple, doesn't mean you leave out on learning the
  complex stuff; instead break it into simpler components.  Simpler items has
  the following advantages:

  - Simple is easier to remember.
  - Simpler items are easier to schedule.  You get more resolution to figure
    out what the problem areas are.
  - Simple makes brings in redundancy automatically.  And [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redundancy_is_good][redundancy is good]]
    for memory, just like it is for managing hardware failure.

- Keep learning fun!  Don't make review sessions a chore.  Think about the
  material you are reviewing. Edit/delete/improve items based on your reviews,
  then and there. Stay active.

- It is useful to add a link to the source of the items added to your system,
  considering that you wish to use the system over a long period of time
  (ideally, the rest of your life!)

- Prioritize, add examples, appeal to your emotional state, link to existing
  knowledge, use images. Anything else that works for you!  Use all of these
  techniques, that work well and you probably already use in everyday life, in
  the items you add to your system, to make them easier to recall.

- Being physically fit and healthy is important for being so
  mentally. Exercise, sleep, eat well, avoid caffeine.

- Try [[http://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm][incremental]] [[http://www.supermemo.com/articles/devour.htm][reading]], as an input source of items into your memory system.
