*Notice for the Internet Usage*

Internet Facility is provided to students for academic activities
and e-mails. It is observed that few students are misusing the
Internet facility by using excessive internet bandwidth for
non-academic purposes. The students who are running the hubs are
strictly informed to close their hubs. Computer Center will be
starting official hub for the sharing of academic information and
open source softwares.

If a student is found while doing so the network facility will be
blocked by Computer Center for a semester. Further, a student will
be called by a disciplinary committee and a severe disciplinary
action will be taken.

This Notice from the Computer Center is creating waves all
around. This isn't the first time, though, that the people
in-charge of the Network have "acted".

Academic activities; wonder what it's definition is, in their
dictionaries. It surely includes the following.

- Using Internet for 'academic activities' or emails, during
  class-room hours makes no sense.
- Anything 'academic' cannot have a size greater than 5 MB.
- Accessing version control systems ( svn, cvs et al ) cannot be
  classified 'academic'
- IRC cannot teach you anything. Don't ever dream of thinking it
  as 'academic' to hang out on \#python or \#emacs
- All 'academic' stuff is limited to the http(s) ports. You
  wouldn't need to use any other ports, ever.
- Any 'academic' activity fits within a span of 2 hours or can be
  done in blocks of 2 hours each, with gaps of 2 hours in between.
- 'Academic' stuff doesn't definitely contain key-words chosen by
  the "all-knowing" admins.

Moreover, the people in-charge who refused to allow the use of a
computer in the CC as a server for on-campus repositories of
GNU/Linux packages, now wish to host a 'hub' for sharing
open-source softwares! There's already an official ftp server
which hosts the academic info and a few useful softwares. I don't
see how a hub would be different.

We don't have any disciplinary committees for people smoking in
hostel rooms, causing a lot of trouble for others around them, but
we are going to have them for hosting hubs. ( Well, a new law
banning smoking in public places in India has been passed just a
few days ago. Hopefully it'll work better than the older one,
since now there's some pressure on the people in-charge of the
public place. )

Also, it could be argued that college isn't meant only for
'academic' learning and a lots of other learning takes place here
(and the hubs were definitely helping quite a bit) but I'll leave
that for another day, probably. Also, I don't think 18+ year olds,
people who are about to step into various big roles, leading the
country need to be told how to make use of the
facilities/resources available to them; A degree of freedom is
indispensable, I believe.

I appreciate the efforts being made to improve the network
situation here and also help the students get the most (
'academically' ) out of their college experience, but I feel the
situation deserves more careful handling.
