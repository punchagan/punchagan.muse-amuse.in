To update some data plan changes, I had to restart my router today.  I did so
from the (web) admin interface, from my dad's laptop. Guess what!  The router
goes invisible (to the laptop), after the restart!  Other devices were still
happily connected.

There were a few occasions in the past when this laptop had failed to find our
home router.  The solution that worked for my dad before was to restart the
router; once, or may be a couple of times.  But, this time it didn't work.

I had a feeling this was something to do with "Channels", but I had no idea
what was going on.

I logged onto the router and started looking at the Wireless settings in the
hope of finding some clue, and there it was! ~Wireless Channel: Auto Scan~

It was anybody's guess that some channels that the router uses weren't
supported by my dad's laptop.  The restarts *sometimes* helped because the
router would scan for channels that it thinks would work well, and end-up using
something that the laptop's wifi card supported.

The router only had options of channels from 1 to 13.  To see what channels a
wifi card supports, you can run the ~iwlist freq~ command.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results code
iwlist freq

          Channel 157 : 5.785 GHz

          Channel 165 : 5.825 GHz

So, the laptop's wifi card support all the channels that the router could use.
~iwlist freq~ also gives the current Channel if the device is already connected
to a router.  I ran this on my laptop and found that the router was using
~Channel 13~.  Why the hell wouldn't this work?!  I don't know!

I decided to set a channel manually, but how do I pick a channel?  The idea of
"Auto Scan" is to find a channel that has relatively low interference.  How do
we do this manually?  ~sudo iwlist scan~ scans for all the WiFi access points
nearby and gives detailed information about them, which includes the Channel.

It looked like most of the routers nearby used channels 1 and 6, with a few 3s
and 4s.  Assuming, most of the other routers aren't doing this "Auto Scan"
business, I set my router to always use Channel 9, and the laptop seems to be
happily connected, now!
