  There is a time and a place for reflection and contemplation about
  the greater universe. Now, I know I sound like a hypocrite because I
  do write about these things a lot, but I’ll tell you now, as someone
  who does over-think it, sometimes you just have to let it be what it
  is and not become overwhelmed by the vastness, mysteriousness and
  unknown possibility that lies around us. It can be more debilitating
  than inspiring sometimes.

  "Sachin saw Hemant and asked in Marathi 'Me zaaoo ka?' ('Can I go')?
  Before Hemant could nod his head, Sachin was already in the field as
  a substitute for Pakistan. It was towards the end of the match and
  Sachin was on the field for about 25 minutes."

  Deep down, many of us wonder if we’re wasting our time on things of
  little consequence. So we keep skittering along the surface at a
  feverish pace, avoiding the mirror of introspection.

  I’ve found recently that when the time is used well, slowness can
  actually be one of the most profound sources of abundance.

  And on the positive side, sometimes entrepreneurs work on their
  businesses after hours out of love, rather than straining toward an
  overly-optimistic deadline out of fear. I’ve been there, I’ve put in
  the hours and I’ll do it again. But not unless I’m motivated by
  love.
