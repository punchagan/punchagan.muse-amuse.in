gora asked for some good links (on ##linux-india) to redirect
newbies, enthusiastic about contributing to FOSS.

I dug up a few links from the web - some that I read, when I
was starting off with using GNU/Linux and FOSS, others are
newer links.

Just making a note of them here; hoping someone would find it
useful.

+ How to Become a Hacker - A definitive how-to on becoming a
  hacker. Answers all the right questions. :)

+ Philosophy of the GNU Project - This is the page, where I
  started. Thanks to Voodoo for giving me the link to this page. I
  distinctly remember that day. :) I'm going to pass on this link
  to any newbie who comes my way, no matter how much bashing I get
  from other FOSS evangelists.

+ 6 Easy Ways To Get Started Programming Open Source - A neat list
  giving steps to get started with programming for open source. I
  like #4. Understanding the social dynamics of the project is an
  important thing which is often overlooked by newbies.

+ OpenHatch - A community site to help newbies get started with
  contributing to FOSS. A cool site. Also, here is a story about
  OpenHatch.

+ Look at the Numbers! - an interesting paper giving quantitative
  data in support of using FOSS.

+ Ubuntu - Code of Conduct - A nice description of general conduct
  expected in any of the FOSS communities, not just Ubuntu.

I'd be happy to add any other links that any of you share. Thanks!
