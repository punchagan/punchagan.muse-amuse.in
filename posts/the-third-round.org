This post is just to keep up a promise that I made to a friend of mine (well,
actually myself).  Presently, its the placement heat in our campus and people
are busy writing tests, waiting, giving interviews and partying. This post
doesn't have much to with all that though.  In one of the interviews, I was
called back and asked about my Cleft Lip and Palate[fn:clp]. The interview
panel had concerns if I faced any serious medical problems due to this. I
explained to them everything that I knew about it and they were convinced.

Later, I realized, I never explicitly did any reading on this issue or asked my
parents/others about this. I somehow knew about it always. I probably learnt at
all those visits to the dentist or may be sub-consciously, when I was a
baby. It isn't, though, surprising to me that those guys had some reservations
about it. It's not everyday that you see a guy with a Cleft, though statistics
say there's prevalence of 1 in 500 births world-wide. As a matter of fact, I
myself haven't seen another guy all my life (except for the pictures at my
dentists') (also, they weren't too wrong in suspecting other problems, though
they had absolutely no clue about this medical condition)

If you are wondering what the point of this post is, it's nothing. It's just a
pointer to those interested in reading further on Cleft Lip and Palate.
