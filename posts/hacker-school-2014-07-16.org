- Started pairing with Kyle on his idea of building a spectrum analyzer on the
  RaspberryPi using a LED Strip.  Both of us were fairly new to the RPi, and we
  spent the morning, setting it up, and stepping through steps in [[https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-spectrum-analyzer-display-on-rgb-led-strip][this tutorial]].
- The tutorial, I felt, wasn't very well written, and definitely not suitable
  for absolute beginners to start with.
- The code didn't seem to work for us, too.  The project put together a bunch
  of libraries, in a way that someone who knew their way could follow along.
- Dana helped us and explained many things, about differences between SPI/GPIO,
  and the precautions to take, helped us hook up stuff, etc.  It was great to
  have her stepping in an helping every now and then!
- While Kyle was pairing on an Alum, I worked through the Graph Theory chapter
  in the Think Complexity book, and read about the abrupt changes of
  characteristics in random graphs, that were very similar and related to the
  phenomenon in percolation theory that Nava explained.
- Later in the day, I played around with the python-googlevoice API, that
  someone laboriously wrote after lot of careful html/xml parsing.
- I spent the night, refactoring the code to display random data on the
  LEDStrip as a display of columns.  And then also ended up cleaning up the
  setup scripts, and the way things need to be installed.
