I first heard of this book in a discussion on relationships amongst friends
from RC.  The discussion was quite interesting and the book received more than
a couple of strong recommendations. So, I decided to pick it up.

Very simply, the book is codified common sense explaining what Love is. Gary
Chapman, the author, started with the question "What makes you feel loved" and
found that the answers could be grouped into the following 5 categories:

1. Words of affirmation
2. Quality time
3. Receiving gifts
4. Acts of service
5. Physical touch

He also found that people have a *primary* language of love, and a failure to
speak this language would make the person feel unloved.  The book is filled
with anecdotes to explain what each of these languages means and how to speak
them, along with practical advice and exercises to learn to speak each of these
languages.  Though the book has been written with couples in mind, the
fundamental ideas in this book can be applied to any relationships. I feel like
it has been helping me connect a few dots, ever since I've started reading it.

It has been totally worth my time to read this book. A highly recommended read!

Below are some of my notes. Feel free to suggest improvements (for readability
and otherwise) on the notes.
