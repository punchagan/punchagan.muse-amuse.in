#+END_COMMENT


- I finished parts of the phonebook task today.  The code looks ugly,
  and very un-haskelly.  I asked for feedback on it, but I guess its
  just too ugly for anyone to take the time out to comment on it, and
  help me improve it.
- I also tried to read up about Monads, and worked through exercises
  from a few different places.  I haven't yet finished the exercises
  in Chapter 12 of the UPenn course.  I just looked at them today, and
  they seem like a complete bouncer at first glance.
- I went on a really long walk with Naren, and food-hopped with him
  while he was telling me stories about the various places he worked
  at and the kinds of things he has been working on, and things he
  liked and disliked about them.  It has been a good weekend to spend
  with Naren!
- Also, the long walk and talking to Chaitu cleared my head a bit, and
  I decided to pause the Haskell tutorials and learning for the next
  couple of weeks.  I don't really have a project that needs me to
  learn Haskell, right now.  I should stick to project and need based
  learning, which I enjoy the most.
- Right now, I feel like working on an key stroke acoustic emanation
  based key-logger.  Just before applying to Hacker School, I came
  across the idea of side-channel attacks, and it sounded pretty
  exciting.  I don't intend to snoop onto anybody, but the project
  seems to be challenging enough, and I will have quite a bit to learn
  about. It will involve signal processing, and learning -- both areas
  that I have seemed interesting to me for long, but I haven't really
  done anything in them.  I plan to work on the idea for a couple of
  weeks, and review my progress and chart my future course. The
  problem appears to have 2 parts to it.
  - Processing audio, and extracting key-strokes from it.
  - Identifying the text, based on a sequence of key-strokes. Though,
    in reality each press of a key may not sound the same, for a start
    assuming we are able to accurately get a sequence of key-strokes,
    the problem would reduce to solving a simple substitution cipher.
    I plan to start with this, tomorrow.
- Also, I plan to hang out a lot more with Hacker Schoolers, and let
  myself be distracted a lot more by random discussions and
  activities, than I have allowed myself to be, in the past few weeks.
  I should be writing as much code as I can, while I'm here.  But, I
  should also be rubbing elbows with the awesome folks, which I will
  only be able to virtually, once I'm out of here.
- Thanks to Amber, I also came across this interesting looking book
  called [[http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813][Apprenticeship patterns]].  I plan to read it over the next
  week or two.
- I haven't been playing almost any Ultimate here. I atleast need to
  work out a conditioning and throwing practice schedule and start
  working on it, early next week.  Tomorrow won't work since it's 5am
  and I'm still awake!
- I also probably need to get enough sleep!
- Looking forward to the next couple of weeks!
