  I’ve encountered a few misconceptions about what Hacker School is
  and who it’s for. I’m not an official source of information; for
  that, I recommend the User’s Manual and this blog post. Having said
  that, here are a few things I’ve heard people say that attest to
  misconceptions about Hacker School, and my responses to them.

  From Angelo’s blog: “I remember the exact moment…Jen’s voice and the
  numb feeling that enveloped me. That feeling has never left. I’ll
  also never forget how we looked into each other’s eyes and held each
  other’s hands. ‘We are together, we’ll be ok.’”

  Throughout her battle, Angelo decided to photograph it. He wanted to
  humanize  the face of cancer on the face of his wife. The photos
  speak for themselves.

  It takes 10,000 hours to become an “expert in an ultra competitive
  field” but to go from “knowing nothing to being pretty good”,
  actually takes 20 hours. The equivalent of 45 minutes a day for a
  month.

  My commute is a journey. A journey toward finding the right balance
  between the two cities. This is Bangalore. The city offers you
  everything you need and sits back and watches while you imprudently
  pick only what you want.
