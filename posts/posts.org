#+END_COMMENT




I am beginning to notice something about my posts [ok.. there
aren't many that make it here.. :P] There are sometimes, when I
feel I should write about a specific thing. I feel as if, there
has to be a post about this, and there's no way I can't write
about it.

But then I have limited access to net here... and even less time
when I'm alone, to write up something. I definitely cannot access
net immediately, whenever I get that 'feel' to write about
something. So the post is postponed...  And later, when I think
about it, or do get access to net... it seems that topic isn't
worth writing.. or that 'feel' isn't there anymore..

I wonder if this would have been the case with my other posts
too.. if only I waited longer to post them?? [But on reading some
of the older posts I don't feel so much that way...] Am I being
lazy?? [Is this how other blogs die down?] Is it that my life is
dull and boring here (if it was so bad.. I guess I would've
managed to write about boredom! :P).. and there's nothing worth
writing? [and I am just thinking of something to keep my blog
alive?]  Is my blog closer to its end than it is to its beginning?
[I don't think so.. its only a matter of time before I get back to
coll.. :P] But is it the best way to be posting
[instinctively... immediately]??? Or is there something better
that I should be learning.. that I should have learnt by now??

BTW.. why do people blog at all?? What's the whole point of
Blogging? [Yes, I haven't still understood what it is.. even after
about 30 posts...]
