  :life:happiness:meaning:

  People ask what is the meaning of life, as if there is a single
  answer. There is no one answer: there are thousands of different
  ones. A life will be meaningful if it finds responses to the four
  questions of purpose, value, efficacy, and self-worth. It is these
  questions, not the answers, that endure and unify.

  :art:

  Art, and what we do and do not consider to be art, has changed a lot
  over the last century. It has become an increasingly difficult thing
  to define for the average person, and sometimes even art historians
  and experts can’t seem to keep up.

  This was illustrated in a 2005 survey done by ABC News in which
  modern masters’ works were mixed into a series with paintings done
  by children and toddlers. Regular people and art critics alike were
  asked to choose from the series – which of these works belong in a
  museum and which ones don’t? Now, Buzzfeed has released a similar
  survey as well, which we’ve expanded on a bit.

  The results of that survey indicate that either we have a long way
  to go before we can define what is and isn’t modern art, or that
  there’s no need to define it so strictly in the first
  place. Whatever the case may be, let’s see if you’re any better at
  telling modern art from children’s drawings than the experts are!
