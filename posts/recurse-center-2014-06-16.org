#+END_COMMENT

- Didn't do anything during the weekend.  Hopefully, this won't be the
  case all of the weekends.  I had fun with my cousins, though.
- Denise is already working on a twitter app that sounds similar to
  the idea I had.
- I accidentally discovered that evince supports vim-like keybindings,
  which is cool.
- When writing patterns for a function it helps to write the most
  general case first, and then write the edge cases.
- I was feeling a little unproductive in the afternoon and I ended up
  attending Zach's talk on [[https://github.com/hackerschool/community][Community]].  I got a brief overview of the
  whole architecture, and got to know a little bit about reactjs and
  om. I don't think I'll get around to contributing to the project,
  since most of the stack is totally new to me, and I'm not
  particularly inclined to learn those things now.
- I was working on Monoids for most part of the day and got through
  exercise 7.  I started doing the I/O exercise around the end of the
  day.
- The day ended with a talk on jobs related stuff by Nick and Sonali.
  It seems super unlikely for me to get a job (in the US), from what I
  understood from them.  So, I needn't worry too much about that and
  focus on getting better at Haskel and as a programmer in general.
