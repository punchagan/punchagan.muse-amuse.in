+I'd+ We had been on a 60 km long trip today. My second one, and
Ritesh's first. The map of our route is here. On the whole the ride
was wonderful! A thoroughly enjoyable one. It was near perfect, with
it raining only as much as we enjoyed an not anymore. :)

+ The ride on Godbander Road was the most enjoyable part of the
  ride. Simple Wonderful! That's what made the trip worth it!

+ It was more relaxed than my previous ride and it took us about 5
  hours on the whole. We must've been pedalling for about 4 hours. I
  don't have the "actual" figures.

+ Except for the stretch of Western express highway (service road)
  from Jogeshwari to a little after the Sanjay Gandhi National park's
  entrance, the road was decent. The Eastern Express highway service
  road was awesome!

+ Cycling alone is totally different from cycling with someone
  else. We didn't really go together, but we were meeting up once in a
  while. The loneliness, of rides on which you are alone, is
  absent. But waiting for, or catching up with the other guy is a bit
  tricky. I wonder how it would be with a bigger group.

+ I tried to keep going at about 60% effort and I still had quite a
  bit of juice left in me, at the end of the ride.

+ My cycle is definitely good! I really only understood this after
  exchanging my cycle.

+ Exchanging cycles felt nice. A slightly different set of muscles
  were in action. The newness kinda helped.

+ I should probably get myself a bigger round frame spectacles. Or I'm
  craning my neck a bit too much, to keep looking ahead, while
  pedaling. How about contacts?

+ The problem with riding on the left of Highways is that you
  "compete" with heavy vehicles. It sometimes gets a bit scary.

+ I should get a helmet soon.

+ I should get in touch with local cycling groups and tag along with
  them on a couple of rides. I'll get to learn a lot of things.

+ Ritesh took a few pics with his phone. +Photos in some later post or
  with an update+.

+ Where to next? A ride inside the National park, probably or the
  wonderful roads of Navi Mumbai.

Kudos Ritesh!

*UPDATE:* A few pictures, that Ritesh clicked on his phone. All the
photos were on the Godbander Road.
