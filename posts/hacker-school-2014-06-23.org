- The Apprenticeship patterns book is very interesting!  I shall
  continue to read it and start create daily/weekly rituals from the
  actions prescribed in the book!
- I was reading [[http://blogs.collab.net/git/protect-git-history#.U6fixh-caV4][this post]] on ~git gc~, ~reflog~, etc. and wanted to
  see what the default values were for some of the configurable
  variables.  But, the git config command didn't help.  Developer/code
  defaults are also a part of the "config" system, and any tools to
  inspect config variables should display them, if no other values
  have been set explicitly!
- "If experience is built upon failure as much as success, then you
  need a more or less private space where you can seek out failure."
  -- Apprenticeship Patterns.
- Our check-in groups changed, but 3 of us from our last check-in
  group are together again!
- Most of the day was spent with Git.  In the morning, I learned that
  setting ~push.default~ to ~nothing~ will prevent pushing any
  branches without specifying explicitly which branch I want to push.
- Also, later in the day, Alan gave a presentation mapping the
  internals of git to the commands, trying to give everyone a better
  mental model of Git.
- I spent some time trying to get ~jedi~ integration for ~emacs~. It
  should've worked out of the box, but I'm not sure the ELPA
  repositories have proper dependency/version management.  Seems to be
  the problem, everywhere!  Dependencies of a package get updated, and
  the package starts acting up...
- Chaitu sent me a link about solving mazes using Finite Automata, and
  I spent some time trying to write a simple solver, and compare it
  with Nava's breadth first search.  But, it looks like we broke her
  code during the refactor.  I may get back to this, at some point.
- I also spent a few minutes talking to Kyle, while he was trying to
  implement a simple version of the NTP protocol.  The algorithm it
  turns out, is pretty simple.
- I started reading a little bit on crypt-analysis for Simple
  Substitution ciphers, and I'll try implementing one of the
  algorithms today.
- The day ended with yummy pizza and video watching!  We watched --
  - Bret Victor, [[http://vimeo.com/36579366][Inventing on Principle]] (54 min)
  - Gary Bernhardt, [[https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat][WAT]] (4 min)
  - Guy Steele, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0][Growing a Language]] (53 min)
