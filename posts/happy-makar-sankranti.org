I loved this Google doodle and immediately felt the urge to wish
all of you (using it). I haven't been at home for Sankranti (read
as kite-flying-festival, for me) since 5 years. I haven't been
much of a kite-flyer, but I did have my share of moments! Hope you
guys have a great time "flying".

ps1: Read the "Kite Runner" by Khaled Hosseini, if you haven't
yet.

ps2: This is my first post of 2010. ;)
