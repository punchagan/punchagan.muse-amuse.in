I am unread.  Unlike you, who classify yourselves as well-read or
not, I am classified as unread or not.  Well, you could call me
not well-read too, I guess.  I was looked at once, my innards
glanced through, and was hurriedly marked as unread, starred and
tagged.  Given my length, the care with which I was composed, and
the flurry with which I was stowed away, I probably contain
something important, to be read at the opportune moment, something
to be cherished and to be replied to with diligence and care.  I
felt a sense of pride.

I got composed and sent weeks ago, and have been lying here
untouched, since.  I get buried deeper and deeper every day, with
a daily flood of newer stuff piling up onto me.  While my
composer, eagerly awaits a reply, (less and less eagerly each day,
though) I have lost all hope of being read and replied to.  I
curse myself for carrying something so important.  A thousand
other replies have been sent, and a few thousand others composed
here, but my turn hasn't come, yet.

How I wish, it'd be my turn today.  How I wish, I could push my
way up through to the top of the stack.  How I wish, I could see
the eager wait come to an end!  How I wish, I'm given the
attention I deserved, today!  Reply, ASAP!

PS: Apologies for all those emails that are still starred and
unread, in my Inbox...
