- I spent about an hour in the morning testing out the staging blaggregator
  instance, and things seemed to work as expected.  Side note, I got added as a
  collaborator on the blaggregator repo!
- We worked through the first chapter on getting video working, but we mostly
  ended up just copying code rather than actually understanding/carefully
  studying it.  I'm not sure how I feel about it, but we got to display fancy
  stuff.
- I wasn't feeling like working on any of my 'old'/'ongoing' projects, and
  since Mondays don't feel very productive, I worked on writing a couple of
  simple scripts to create twitter lists of HSers, batch wise.

  For the HS API, I just reused some old code I had lying around from my
  experiments with the OAuth2 API, though I had to tweak it a little bit to be
  able to actually login, using requests. Something about CSRF tokens seems to
  have changed.

  In the process, I found that twitter's API isn't very pleasant to use.  Or
  may be it's the fact that I was using python twitter client without getting
  my own client id/key, but the whole experience of dealing with the twitter
  API wasn't a pleasant one at all!
- Amber, Daria and I also spent about an hour white-boarding some problems from
  the Cracking the Code Interview book.
- I ended up fixing some minor issues with blaggregator and am hoping that the
  long pending PR will be merged today.
