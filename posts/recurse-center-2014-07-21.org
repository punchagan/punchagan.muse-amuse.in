* Yesterday

- It was exciting to have so many new Hacker Schoolers in the space.  But, the
  excitement was kinda distracting too.

- I spent most of the day looking at shairport, and libshairport and trying to
  wrap it, so I can use it to get data for the spectrum analyzer via the
  Air-play protocol.  I was able to call it using ~ctypes~, but it doesn't seem
  discoverable.

- I also briefly looked at Julia and [[http://dwm.suckless.org][dwm]], to try and port dwm to Julia.  It
  doesn't seem like too much work, but is going to take me a while given how
  comfortable I'm with both Julia and C.

- Yaron Minsky's talk on distributed systems was a great introduction to
  Distributed systems.

- After the talk, I spent a little time updating my notes from an old org-mode
  workshop to present it at the emacs user group meet up today.

* Today

- I hope to get the spectrum analyzer to use ~libshairport~ and be able to play
  music sent through Air play.

- Spend some time talking to the emacs user group about org-mode.

- If I have any time, after getting this to work, I may play around with the
  dwm port.
