I was just wondering, a couple of nights ago, at dinner.. "When
did I first decide that I would be doing Engineering?" The answer
-- I don't know...  All I know is that, during my High schooling I
was more interested in Maths and Science {Physics specially...}
Then I did what most just-out-of-school kids with an interest in
Math &amp; Science do {specially in that part of the world where I
live, Andhra Pradesh} Took up Math.Phys.Chem in intermediate and
prepare for Engg. entrance tests alongside. After failing to get a
rank that would fetch me an *Engg. course* in any of the IITs, I
landed here..

Then the choice of discipline, that was just based on popular
opinion and luck [called preferential allotment...] and I finally
ended up in EEE.

But the question is when did I make that choice of becoming a
so-called Engineer? Did I ever consider the alternatives and make
a decision? If yes, then when?? What kind of an engineer did I
choose to become? Did I make the choice of becoming an electrical
engineer??

I think, I never knew what kind of an Engineer I wanted to be.[
with the knowledge of an average School pass out..., you wouldn't
expect one to know all about the various fields of Engineering.] I
think, I never even exactly knew [and don't do so now...], what it
means to be an Engineer. An *Electrical and Electronics Engineer*.

But isn't it important that we the future "Engineers" of the
Country, know what it means to be one and what is expected of us?
Isn't that knowledge essential, for taking a decision to do
engineering.. and also to make the most out of the Engineering
programme?

I wonder what field {or profession or whatever you call that...} I
would choose, if I were given a chance now... [i.e after a couple
of years in an Engineering College...]... I wonder which
discipline I would choose after getting this little insight into
the various fields in Engineering... I wonder what I would choose,
if I get this chance, a couple of years later... or five years
later... :D

Engineering is a great profession. There is the fascination of
watching a figment of the imagination emerge through the aid of
science to a plan on paper. Then it moves to realization in stone
or metal or energy. Then it brings homes to men or women. Then it
elevates the standard of living and adds to the comforts of
life. This is the engineer's high privilege. -- Herbert Hoover
