Yes, that's what my PS's been like.. It hasn't turned out to be as
great a learning experience as one would imagine it to be..  [or
atleast I hoped, it would be...] On the contrary, its turning out
to be bad...

Nowadays, there's a certain danger of the same thing
happening, even in the famous field of physics. I was shocked to
hear of an experiment being done at the big accelerator at the
National Accelerator Laboratory, where a person used deuterium. In
order to compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen
with light hydrogen, he had to use data from someone else's
experiment on light hydrogen, which was done on a different
apparatus. When asked why, he said it was because he couldn't get
time on the program (because there's so little time and it's such
expensive apparatus) to do the experiment with light hydrogen on
this apparatus because there wouldn't be any new result. And so
the men in charge of programs at NAL are so anxious for new
results, in order to get more money to keep the thing going for
public relations purposes, they are destroying -- possibly -- the
value of the experiments themselves, which is the whole purpose of
the thing. It is often hard for the experimenters there to
complete their work as their scientific integrity
demands.

When I first read this {from Feynman's Cargo Cult Science [Adapted
from a Caltech commencement address in 1974]}, I couldn't quite
figure out what or how exactly things are happening and what
exactly Feynman meant by "losing the value of experiments". But,
now I know.. thanks to my PS. A lot of stuff that goes on
here..[at least from what I can see..] is quite similar to (in
fact worse than) this. PS's been absolutely disappointing.. I
don't think I've learnt anything here that's worth the effort of
spending my hols (too), away from home...  [except for Awe-TEM] I
don't think I will be taking back anything with me..  other than
may be, a knowledge of stuff that I shouldn't learn, stuff that I
should keep away for the rest of my life...

Feynman is saying this to *me*, Right now!

... I have just one wish for you -- the good luck to be somewhere
where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have
described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain
your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on,
to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.
